<h2 class="main">Translator&rsquo;s Preface.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The work of which I here offer an English translation
has excited, among the Dutch and German literary societies, a keen
controversy in regard to its authenticity&mdash;a controversy not yet
brought to a conclusion, some affirming that it contains internal
evidence of truth, while others declare it to be a forgery. But even
the latter do not insist on its being the work of a modern fabricator.
They allow it to be one hundred, or perhaps one hundred and fifty,
years old. If they admit that, I do not see why they refuse it a
greater antiquity; and as to the improbability of the stories related
in it, I refer the reader to the exhaustive inquiry in Dr
Ottema&rsquo;s Preface.</p>
<p>Is it more difficult to believe that the early Frisians, being hardy
and intrepid marine adventurers, sailed to the Mediterranean, and even
proceeded farther, than that the Ph&oelig;nicians sailed to England for
tin, and to the Baltic for amber? or that a clever woman <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e214" href="#xd21e214" name=
"xd21e214">vi</a>]</span>became a lawgiver at Athens, than that a
goddess sprang, full grown and armed, from the cleft skull of
Jupiter?</p>
<p>There is nothing in the narratives of this book inconsistent with
probability, however they may vary from some of our preconceived ideas;
but whether it is really what it pretends to be&mdash;a very ancient
manuscript, or a more modern fiction&mdash;it is not the less a most
curious and interesting work, and as such I offer it to the British
public.</p>
<p>In order to give an idea of the manuscript, I have procured
photographs of two of its pages, which are bound with this volume.</p>
<p>I have also followed Dr Ottema&rsquo;s plan of printing the original
Frisian opposite to the translation, so that any reader possessing a
knowledge of the language may verify the correctness of the
translation.</p>
<p>In addition to the Preface which I have translated, Dr Ottema has
written two pamphlets on the subject of the Oera Linda Book (1.
Historical Notes and Explanations; 2. The Royal Academy and <span lang=
"nl">Het Oera Linda Bok</span>), both of which would be very valuable
to any one who wished to study the controversy respecting the
authenticity of the work, but which I have not thought it necessary to
translate for the present publication. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e227" href="#xd21e227" name="xd21e227">vii</a>]</span></p>
<p>There has also appeared in the &ldquo;<span lang="nl">Deventer
Courant</span>&rdquo; a series of twelve letters on the same subject.
Though written anonymously, I believe they are from the pen of
Professor Vitringa. They have been translated into German by Mr
Otto.</p>
<p>The writer evidently entered upon his task of criticism with a
feeling of disbelief in the authenticity of the book; but in his last
letter he admits that, after a minute examination, he is unable to
pronounce a positive conviction either for or against it.</p>
<p>His concluding remarks are to the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the book is a romance, then I must admit that it has been
written with a good object, and by a clever man, because the sentiments
expressed in it are of a highly moral tendency; and the facts related,
so far as they can be controlled by regular history, are not
untruthful; and where they deal with events of which we have no
historical records, they do not offend our ideas of possibility or even
probability.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 class="main">Introduction.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">C. over de Linden, Chief Superintendent of the Royal
Dockyard at the Helder, possesses a very ancient manuscript, which has
been inherited and preserved in his family from time immemorial,
without any one knowing whence it came or what it contained, owing to
both the language and the writing being unknown.</p>
<p>All that was known was that a tradition contained in it had from
generation to generation been recommended to careful preservation. It
appeared that the tradition rests upon the contents of two letters,
with which the manuscript begins, from Hiddo oera Linda, anno 1256, and
from Liko oera Linda, anno 803. It came to C. over de Linden by the
directions of his grandfather, <span lang="nl">Den Heer Andries over de
Linden</span>, who lived at Enkhuizen, and died there on the 15th of
April 1820, aged sixty-one. As the grandson was at that time barely ten
years old, the manuscript was taken care of for him by his aunt, Aafje
Meylhoff, born Over de Linden, living at Enkhuizen, who in August 1848
delivered it to the present possessor.</p>
<p>Dr E. Verwijs having heard of this, requested permission to examine
the manuscript, and immediately recognised it as very ancient Fries. He
obtained at the same time permission to make a copy of it for the
benefit of the Friesland Society, and was of opinion that it might be
of great importance, provided it was not supposititious, and invented
for some deceptive object, which he feared. The manuscript <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e256" href="#xd21e256" name=
"xd21e256">vi</a>]</span>being placed in my hands, I also felt very
doubtful, though I could not understand what object any one could have
in inventing a false composition only to keep it a secret. This doubt
remained until I had examined carefully-executed facsimiles of two
fragments, and afterwards of the whole manuscript&mdash;the first sight
of which convinced me of the great age of the document.</p>
<p>Immediately occurred to me C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s remark upon the
writing of the Gauls and the Helvetians in his &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Bello Gallico</span>&rdquo; (i. 29, and vi. 14),
&ldquo;<span lang="la">Gr&aelig;cis utuntur literis</span>,&rdquo;
though it appears in v. 48 that they were not entirely Greek letters.
C&aelig;sar thus points out only a resemblance&mdash;and a very true
one&mdash;as the writing, which does not altogether correspond with any
known form of letters, resembles the most, on a cursory view, the Greek
writing, such as is found on monuments and the oldest manuscripts, and
belongs to the form which is called lapidary. Besides, I formed the
opinion afterwards that the writer of the latter part of the book had
been a contemporary of C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>The form and the origin of the writing is so minutely and fully
described in the first part of the book, as it could not be in any
other language. It is very complete, and consists of thirty-four
letters, among which are three separate forms of <i>a</i> and u, and
two of <i>e, i</i>, y, and <i>o</i>, besides four pairs of double
consonants&mdash;<i>ng, th, ks</i>, and <i>gs</i>. The <i>ng</i>, which
as a nasal sound has no particular mark in any other Western language,
is an indivisible conjunction; the <i>th</i> is soft, as in English,
and is sometimes replaced by <i>d</i>; the <i>gs</i> is seldom met
with&mdash;I believe only in the word <i>segse</i>, to say, in modern
Fries <i>sidse</i>, pronounced <i>sisze</i>.</p>
<p>The paper, of large quarto size, is made of cotton, not very thick,
without water-mark or maker&rsquo;s mark, made upon a frame or
wire-web, with not very broad perpendicular lines.</p>
<p>An introductory letter gives the year 1256 as that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e310" href="#xd21e310" name=
"xd21e310">vii</a>]</span>in which this manuscript was written by Hiddo
overa Linda on foreign paper. Consequently it must have come from
Spain, where the Arabs brought into the market paper manufactured from
cotton.</p>
<p>On this subject, W. Wattenbach writes in his &ldquo;<span lang=
"de">Das Schriftwesen im Mittelalter</span>&rdquo; (Leipzig, 1871), s.
93:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The manufacture of paper from cotton must have been in use
among the Chinese from very remote times, and must have become known to
the Arabs by the conquest of Samarcand about the year 704. In Damascus
this manufacture was an important branch of industry, for which reason
it was called <i lang="la">Charta Damascena</i>. By the Arabians this
art was brought to the Greeks. It is asserted that Greek manuscripts of
the tenth century written upon cotton paper exist, and that in the
thirteenth century it was much more used than parchment. To distinguish
it from Egyptian paper it was called <i lang="la">Charta bombicina,
gossypina, cuttunea, xylina</i>. A distinction from linen paper was not
yet necessary. In the manufacture of the cotton paper raw cotton was
originally used. We first find paper from rags mentioned by Petrus
Clusiacensis (1122&ndash;50).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Spaniards and the Italians learned the manufacture of
this paper from the Arabians. The most celebrated factories were at
Jativa, Valencia, Toledo, besides Fabriano in the March of
Ancona.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e327src" href="#xd21e327"
name="xd21e327src">1</a></p>
<p>In Germany the use of this material did not become very extended,
whether it came from Italy or Spain. Therefore the further this
preparation spread from the East and the adjoining countries, the more
necessity there was that linen should take the place of cotton. A
document of Kaufbeuren on linen paper of the year 1318 is of very
doubtful genuineness. Bodman considers the oldest pure <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e342" href="#xd21e342" name=
"xd21e342">viii</a>]</span>linen paper to be of the year 1324, but up
to 1350 much mixed paper was used. All carefully-written manuscripts of
great antiquity show by the regularity of their lines that they must
have been ruled, even though no traces of the ruled lines can be
distinguished. To make the lines they used a thin piece of lead, a
ruler, and a pair of compasses to mark the distances.</p>
<p>In old writings the ink is very black or brown; but while there has
been more writing since the thirteenth century, the colour of the ink
is often grey or yellowish, and sometimes quite pale, showing that it
contains iron. All this affords convincing proof that the manuscript
before us belongs to the middle of the thirteenth century, written with
clear black letters between fine lines carefully traced with lead. The
colour of the ink shows decidedly that it does not contain iron. By
these evidences the date given, 1256, is satisfactorily proved, and it
is impossible to assign any later date. Therefore all suspicion of
modern deception vanishes.</p>
<p>The language is very old Fries, still older and purer than the Fries
Rjuchtboek or old Fries laws, differing from that both in form and
spelling, so that it appears to be an entirely distinct dialect, and
shows that the locality of the language must have been (as it was
spoken) between the Vlie and the Scheldt.</p>
<p>The style is extremely simple, concise, and unembarrassed,
resembling that of ordinary conversation, and free in the choice of the
words. The spelling is also simple and easy, so that the reading of it
does not involve the least difficulty, and yet with all its regularity,
so unrestricted, that each of the separate writers who have worked at
the book has his own peculiarities, arising from the changes in
pronunciation in a long course of years, which naturally must have
happened, as the last part of the work is written five centuries after
the first. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e350" href="#xd21e350"
name="xd21e350">ix</a>]</span></p>
<p>As a specimen of antiquity in language and writing, I believe I may
venture to say that this book is unique of its kind.</p>
<p>The writing suggests an observation which may be of great
importance.</p>
<p>The Greeks know and acknowledge that their writing was not their own
invention. They attribute the introduction of it to Kadmus, a
Phenician. The names of their oldest letters, from Alpha to Tau, agree
so exactly with the names of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet, with
which the Phenician will have been nearly connected, that we cannot
doubt that the Hebrew was the origin of the Phenician. But the form of
their letters differs so entirely from that of the Phenician and Hebrew
writing, that in that particular no connection can be thought of
between them. Whence, then, have the Greeks derived the form of their
letters?</p>
<p>From &ldquo;thet bok th&ecirc;ra Adela folstar&rdquo; (&ldquo;The
Book of Adela&rsquo;s Followers&rdquo;) we learn that in the time when
Kadmus is said to have lived, about sixteen centuries before Christ, a
brisk trade existed between the Frisians and the Phenicians, whom they
named Kadhemar, or dwellers on the coast.</p>
<p>The name Kadmus comes too near the word Kadhemar for us not to
believe that Kadmus simply meant a Phenician.</p>
<p>Further on we learn that about the same time a priestess of the
castle in the island of Walcheren, Min-erva, also called Nyhellenia,
had settled in Attica at the head of a Frisian colony, and had founded
a castle at Athens. Also, from the accounts written on the walls of
Waraburch, that the Finns likewise had a writing of their own&mdash;a
very troublesome and difficult one to read&mdash;and that, therefore,
the Tyrians and the Greeks had learned the writing of Frya. By this
representation the whole thing explains itself, and it becomes clear
whence comes the exterior <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e363" href=
"#xd21e363" name="xd21e363">x</a>]</span>resemblance between the Greek
and the old Fries writing, which C&aelig;sar also remarked among the
Gauls; as likewise in what manner the Greeks acquired and retained the
names of the Finn and the forms of the Fries writing.</p>
<p>Equally remarkable are the forms of their figures. We usually call
our figures Arabian, although they have not the least resemblance to
those used by the Arabs. The Arabians did not bring their ciphers from
the East, because the Semitic nations used the whole alphabet in
writing numbers. The manner of expressing all numbers by ten signs the
Arabs learned in the West, though the form was in some measure
corresponding with their writing, and was written from left to right,
after the Western fashion. Our ciphers seem here to have sprung from
the Fries ciphers (<i>siffar</i>), which form had the same origin as
the handwriting, and is derived from the lines of the Juul?</p>
<p>The book as it lies before us consists of two parts, differing
widely from each other, and of dates very far apart. The writer of the
first part calls herself Adela, wife of Apol, chief man of the Linda
country. This is continued by her son Adelbrost, and her daughter
Apollonia. The first book, running from page 1 to 88, is written by
Adela. The following part, from 88 to 94, is begun by Adelbrost and
continued by Apollonia. The second book, running from page 94 to 114,
is written by Apollonia. Much later, perhaps two hundred and fifty
years, a third book is written, from page 114 to 134, by Frethorik;
then follows from page 134 to 143, written by his widow, Wiljow; after
that from page 144 to 169 by their son, Konereed; and then from page
169 to 192 by their grandson, Beeden. Pages 193 and 194, with which the
last part must have begun, are wanting, therefore the writer is
unknown. He may probably have been a son of Beeden.</p>
<p>On page 134, Wiljow makes mention of another writing of Adela. These
she names &ldquo;<span lang="fy-oer">thet bok th&ecirc;ra sanga (thet
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e377" href="#xd21e377" name=
"xd21e377">xi</a>]</span>boek), th&ecirc;ra tellinga</span>,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<span lang="fy-oer">thet Hell&ecirc;nia bok</span>;&rdquo; and
afterwards &ldquo;<span lang="fy-oer">tha skrifta fon Adela jeftha
Hell&ecirc;nia</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To fix the date we must start from the year 1256 of our era, when
Hiddo overa Linda made the copy, in which he says that it was 3449
years after Atland was sunk. This disappearance of the old land
(<i lang="fy-oer">&acirc;ldland, &acirc;tland</i>) was known by the
Greeks, for Plato mentions in his &ldquo;Tim&aelig;us,&rdquo; 24, the
disappearance of Atlantis, the position of which was only known as
somewhere far beyond the Pillars of Hercules. From this writing it
appears that it was land stretching far out to the west of Jutland, of
which Heligoland and the islands of North Friesland are the last barren
remnants. This event, which occasioned a great dispersion of the
Frisian race, became the commencement of a chronological reckoning
corresponding with 2193 before Christ, and is known by geologists as
the Cimbrian flood.</p>
<p>On page 80 begins an account in the year 1602, after the
disappearance of Atland, and thus in the year 591 before Christ; and on
page 82 is the account of the murder of Fr&acirc;na,
&ldquo;Eeremoeder,&rdquo; of Texland two years later&mdash;that is, in
589. When, therefore, Adela commences her writing with her own coming
forward in an assembly of the people thirty years after the murder of
the Eeremoeder, that must have been in the year 559 before Christ. In
the part written by her daughter Apollonia, we find that fifteen months
after the assembly Adela was killed by the Finns in an attack by
surprise of Texland. This must accordingly have happened 557 years
before Christ. Hence it follows that the first book, written by Adela,
was of the year 558 before Christ. The second book, by Apollonia, we
may assign to about the year 530 before Christ. The latter part
contains the history of the known kings of Friesland, Friso, Adel
(Ubbo), and Asega Askar, called Black Adel. Of the third king, Ubbo,
nothing is said, or rather that part is lost, as the pages 169 to 188
are missing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e393" href="#xd21e393"
name="xd21e393">xii</a>]</span>Frethorik, the first writer, who appears
now, was a contemporary of the occurrences which he relates, namely,
the arrival of Friso. He was a friend of Liudgert den Geertman, who, as
rear-admiral of the fleet of Wichhirte, the sea-king, had come with
Friso in the year 303 before Christ, 1890 years after the disappearance
of Atland. He has borrowed most of his information from the log-book of
Liudgert.</p>
<p>The last writer gives himself out most clearly as a contemporary of
Black Adel or Askar, about the middle of his reign, which Furmerius
states to have been from 70 before Christ to 11 after the birth of
Christ, the same period as Julius C&aelig;sar and Augustus. He
therefore wrote in the middle of the last century before Christ, and
knew of the conquest of Gaul by the Romans. It is thus evident that
there elapsed fully two centuries between the two parts of the
work.</p>
<p>Of the Gauls we read on page 84 that they were called the
&ldquo;Missionaries of Sydon.&rdquo; And on page 124 &ldquo;that the
Gauls are Druids.&rdquo; The Gauls, then, were Druids, and the name
Galli, used for the whole nation, was really only the name of an order
of priesthood brought from the East, just as among the Romans the Galli
were priests of Cybele.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The whole contents of the book are in all respects new. That is to
say, there is nothing in it that we were acquainted with before. What
we here read of Friso, Adel, and Askar differs entirely from what is
related by our own chroniclers, or rather presents it in quite another
light. For instance, they all relate that Friso came from India, and
that thus the Frisians were of Indian descent; and yet they add that
Friso was a German, and belonged to a Persian race which Herodotus
called Germans (<span class="trans" title="Germanioi"><span class=
"Greek" lang=
"el">&Gamma;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&#8049;&nu;&iota;&omicron;&iota;</span></span>).
According to the statement in this book, Friso did come from India, and
with the fleet of Nearchus; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e411"
href="#xd21e411" name="xd21e411">xiii</a>]</span>but he is not
therefore an Indian. He is of Frisian origin, of Frya&rsquo;s people.
He belongs, in fact, to a Frisian colony which after the death of
Nijhell&ecirc;nia, fifteen and a half centuries before Christ, under
the guidance of a priestess Geert, settled in the Punjab, and took the
name of Geertmen. The Geertmen were known by only one of the Greek
writers, Strabo, who mentions them as <span class="trans" title=
"Germanes"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Gamma;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&#8118;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span></span>,
differing totally and entirely from the <span class="trans" title=
"Brachmanes"><span class="Greek" lang=
"el">&Beta;&rho;&alpha;&chi;&mu;&#8118;&nu;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span></span>
in manners, language, and religion.</p>
<p>The historians of Alexander&rsquo;s expeditions do not speak of
Frisians or Geertmen, though they mention Indoscythians, thereby
describing a people who live in India, but whose origin is in the
distant, unknown North.</p>
<p>In the accounts of Liudgert no names are given of places where the
Frieslanders lived in India. We only know that they first established
themselves to the east of the Punjab, and afterwards moved to the west
of those rivers. It is mentioned, moreover, as a striking fact, that in
the summer the sun at midday was straight above their heads. They
therefore lived within the tropics. We find in Ptolemy (see the map of
Kiepert), exactly 24&deg; N. on the west side of the Indus, the name
Minnagara; and about six degrees east of that, in 22&deg; N., another
Minnagara. This name is pure Fries, the same as Walhallagara, Folsgara,
and comes from Minna, the name of an Eeremoeder, in whose time the
voyages of Teunis and his nephew Inca took place.</p>
<p>The coincidence is too remarkable to be accidental, and not to prove
that Minnagara was the headquarters of the Frisian colony. The
establishment of the colonists in the Punjab in 1551 before Christ, and
their journey thither, we find fully described in Adela&rsquo;s book;
and with the mention of one most remarkable circumstance, namely, that
the Frisian mariners sailed through the strait which in those times
still ran into the Red Sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e435"
href="#xd21e435" name="xd21e435">xiv</a>]</span></p>
<p>In Strabo, book i. pages 38 and 50, it appears that Eratosthenes was
acquainted with the existence of the strait, of which the later
geographers make no mention. It existed still in the time of Moses
(Exodus xiv. 2), for he encamped at Pi-ha-chiroht, the &ldquo;mouth of
the strait.&rdquo; Moreover, Strabo mentions that Sesostris made an
attempt to cut through the isthmus, but that he was not able to
accomplish it. That in very remote times the sea really did flow
through is proved by the result of the geological investigations on the
isthmus made by the Suez Canal Commission, of which M. Renaud presented
a report to the Academy of Sciences on the 19th June 1856. In that
report, among other things, appears the following: &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Une question fort controvers&eacute;e est celle de savoir, si
&agrave; l&rsquo;&eacute;poque o&ugrave; les Hebreux fuyaient de
l&rsquo;Egypte sous la conduite de Mo&iuml;se, les lacs amers faisaient
encore partie de la mer rouge. Cette derni&egrave;re hypoth&egrave;se
s&rsquo;accorderait mieux que l&rsquo;hypoth&egrave;se contraire avec
le texte des livres sacr&eacute;s, mais alors il faudrait admettre que
depuis l&rsquo;&eacute;poque de Mo&iuml;se le seuil de Suez serait
sorti des eaux.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to this question, it is certainly of importance to fall
in with an account in this Frisian manuscript, from which it seems that
in the sixteenth century before Christ the connection between the
Bitter Lakes and the Red Sea still existed, and that the strait was
still navigable. The manuscript further states that soon after the
passage of the Geertmen there was an earthquake; that the land rose so
high that all the water ran out, and all the shallows and alluvial
lands rose up like a wall. This must have happened after the time of
Moses, so that at the date of the Exodus (1564 B.C.) the track between
Suez and the Bitter Lakes was still navigable, but could be forded
dry-foot at low water.</p>
<p>This point, then, is the commencement of the isthmus, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e446" href="#xd21e446" name=
"xd21e446">xv</a>]</span>after the forming of which, the northern inlet
was certainly soon filled up as far as the Gulf of Pelusium.</p>
<p>The map by Louis Figuier, in the &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Ann&eacute;e
scientifique et industrielle</span>&rdquo; (<i lang=
"fr">premi&egrave;re ann&eacute;e</i>), Paris, Hachette, 1857, gives a
distinct illustration of the formation of this land.</p>
<p>Another statement, which occurs only in Strabo, finds also here a
confirmation. Strabo alone of all the Greek writers relates that
Nearchus, after he had landed his troops in the Persian Gulf, at the
mouth of the Pasitigris, sailed out of the Persian Gulf by
Alexander&rsquo;s command, and steered round Arabia through the Arabian
Gulf. As the account stands, it is not clear what Nearchus had to do
there, and what the object of the further voyage was. If, as Strabo
seems to think, it was only for geographical discovery, he need not
have taken the whole fleet. One or two ships would have sufficed. We do
not read that he returned. Where, then, did he remain with that
fleet?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is to be found in the Frisian version of
the story. Alexander had bought the ships on the Indus, or had had them
built by the descendants of the Frisians who settled there&mdash;the
Geertmen&mdash;and had taken into his service sailors from among them,
and at the head of them was Friso. Alexander having accomplished his
voyage and the transport of his troops, had no further use for the
ships in the Persian Gulf, but wished to employ them in the
Mediterranean. He had taken that idea into his head, and it must be
carried into effect. He wished to do what no one had done before him.
For this purpose Nearchus was to sail up the Red Sea, and on his
arrival at Suez was to find 200 elephants, 1000 camels, workmen and
materials, timber and ropes, &amp;c., in order to haul the ships by
land over the isthmus. This work was carried on and accomplished with
so much zeal and energy that after three months&rsquo; labour the fleet
was launched in the Mediterranean. That the fleet really <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e460" href="#xd21e460" name=
"xd21e460">xvi</a>]</span>came to the Mediterranean appears in
Plutarch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Alexander;&rdquo; but he makes Nearchus
bring the fleet round Africa, and sail through the Pillars of
Hercules.</p>
<p>After the defeat at Actium, Cleopatra, in imitation of this example,
tried to take her fleet over the isthmus in order to escape to India,
but was prevented by the inhabitants of Arabia Petr&aelig;a, who burnt
her ships. (See Plutarch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Antony.&rdquo;) When
Alexander shortly afterwards died, Friso remained in the service of
Antigonus and Demetrius, until, having been grievously insulted by the
latter, he resolved to seek out with his sailors their fatherland,
Friesland. To India he could not, indeed, return.</p>
<p>Thus these accounts chime in with and clear up each other, and in
that way afford a mutual confirmation of the events.</p>
<p>Such simple narratives and surprising results led me to conclude
that we had to do here with more than mere Saga and Legends.</p>
<p>Since the last twenty years attention has been directed to the
remains of the dwellings on piles, first observed in the Swiss lakes,
and afterwards in other parts of Europe. (See Dr E. R&uuml;ckert,
&ldquo;<span lang="de">Die Pfahlbauten</span>;&rdquo; W&uuml;rzburg,
1869. Dr T. C. Winkler, in the &ldquo;<span lang=
"nl">Volksalmanak</span>,&rdquo; t. N. v. A. 1867.) When they were
found, endeavours were made to discover, by the existing fragments of
arms, tools, and household articles, by whom and when these dwellings
had been inhabited. There are no accounts of them in historical
writers, beyond what Herodotus writes in book v. chapter 16, of the
&ldquo;Paeonen.&rdquo; The only trace that has been found is in one of
the panels of Trajan&rsquo;s Pillar, in which the destruction of a pile
village in Dacia is represented.</p>
<p>Doubly important, therefore, is it to learn from the writing of
Apollonia that she, as &ldquo;Burgtmaagd&rdquo; (chief of the virgins),
about 540 years before Christ, made a journey <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e478" href="#xd21e478" name=
"xd21e478">xvii</a>]</span>up the Rhine to Switzerland, and there
became acquainted with the Lake Dwellers (Marsaten). She describes
their dwellings built upon piles&mdash;the people
themselves&mdash;their manners and customs. She relates that they lived
by fishing and hunting, and that they prepared the skins of the animals
with the bark of the birch-tree in order to sell the furs to the Rhine
boatmen, who brought them into commerce. This account of the pile
dwellings in the Swiss lakes can only have been written in the time
when these dwellings still existed and were lived in. In the second
part of the writing, Koner&ecirc;d oera Linda relates that Adel, the
son of Friso (&plusmn;250 years before Christ), visited the pile
dwellings in Switzerland with his wife Ifkja.</p>
<p>Later than this account there is no mention by any writer whatever
of the pile dwellings, and the subject has remained for twenty
centuries utterly unknown until 1853, when an extraordinary low state
of the water led to the discovery of these dwellings. Therefore no one
could have invented this account in the intervening period. Although a
great portion of the first part of the work&mdash;the book of
Adela&mdash;belongs to the mythological period before the Trojan war,
there is a striking difference between it and the Greek myths. The
Myths have no dates, much less any chronology, nor any internal
coherence of successive events. The untrammelled fancy develops itself
in every poem separately and independently. The mythological stories
contradict each other on every point. &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Les Mythes
ne se tiennent pas</span>,&rdquo; is the only key to the Greek
Mythology.</p>
<p>Here, on the contrary, we meet with a regular succession of dates
starting from a fixed period&mdash;the destruction of Atland, 2193
before Christ. The accounts are natural and simple, often na&iuml;ve,
never contradict each other, and are always consistent with each other
in time and place. As, for instance, the arrival and sojourn of Ulysses
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e488" href="#xd21e488" name=
"xd21e488">xviii</a>]</span>Burgtmaagd Kalip at Walhallagara
(Walcheren), which is the most mythical portion of all, is here said to
be 1005 years after the disappearance of Atland, which coincides with
1188 years before Christ, and thus agrees very nearly with the time at
which the Greeks say the Trojan war took place. The story of Ulysses
was not brought here for the first time by the Romans. Tacitus found it
already in Lower Germany (see &ldquo;Germania,&rdquo; cap. 3), and says
that at Asciburgium there was an altar on which the names of Ulysses
and his father La&euml;rtes were inscribed.</p>
<p>Another remarkable difference consists in this, that the Myths know
no origin, do not name either writers or relaters of their stories, and
therefore never can bring forward any authority. Whereas in
Adela&rsquo;s book, for every statement is given a notice where it was
found or whence it was taken. For instance, &ldquo;This comes from
Minno&rsquo;s writings&mdash;this is written on the walls of
Waraburch&mdash;this in the town of Frya&mdash;this at
Stavia&mdash;this at Walhallagara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is also this further. Laws, regular legislative enactments,
such as are found in great numbers in Adela&rsquo;s book, are utterly
unknown in Mythology, and indeed are irreconcilable with its existence.
Even when the Myth attributes to Minos the introduction of lawgiving in
Crete, it does not give the least account of what the legislation
consisted in. Also among the Gods of Mythology there existed no system
of laws. The only law was unchangable Destiny and the will of the
supreme Zeus.</p>
<p>With regard to Mythology, this writing, which bears no mythical
character, is not less remarkable than with regard to history.
Notwithstanding the frequent and various relations with Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway, we do not find any traces of acquaintance with the
Northern or Scandinavian Mythology. Only Wodin appears in the person of
Wodan, a chief of the Frisians, who became the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e496" href="#xd21e496" name=
"xd21e496">xix</a>]</span>son-in-law of one Magy, King of the Finns,
and after his death was deified.</p>
<p>The Frisian religion is extremely simple, and pure Monotheism.
Wr-alda or Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit is the only eternal, unchangeable,
perfect, and almighty being. Wr-alda has created everything. Out of him
proceeds everything&mdash;first the beginning, then time, and
afterwards Irtha, the Earth. Irtha bore three daughters&mdash;Lyda,
Finda, and Frya&mdash;the mothers of the three distinct races, black,
yellow, and white&mdash;Africa, Asia, and Europe. As such, Frya is the
mother of Frya&rsquo;s people, the Frieslanders. She is the
representative of Wr-alda, and is reverenced accordingly. Frya has
established her &ldquo;Tex,&rdquo; the first law, and has established
the religion of the eternal light. The worship consists in the
maintenance of a perpetually-burning lamp, <i>foddik,</i> by
priestesses, virgins. At the head of the virgins in every town was a
Burgtmaagd, and the chief of the Burgtmaagden was the Eeremoeder of the
Fryasburgt of Texland. The Eeremoeder governs the whole country. The
kings can do nothing, nor can anything happen without her advice and
approval. The first Eeremoeder was appointed by Frya herself, and was
called F&acirc;sta. In fact, we find here the prototype of the Roman
Vestal Virgins.</p>
<p>We are reminded here of Velleda (Welda) and Aurinia in Tacitus
(&ldquo;Germania,&rdquo; 8. Hist., iv. 61, 65; v. 22, 24.
&ldquo;Annals,&rdquo; i. 54), and of Gauna, the successor of Velleda,
in Dio Cassius (Fragments, 49). Tacitus speaks of the town of Velleda
as &ldquo;edita turris,&rdquo; page 146. It was the town Mannagarda
forda (Munster).</p>
<p>In the county of the Marsians he speaks of the temple Tanfane
(Tanfanc), so called from the sign of the Juul. (See plate I.)</p>
<p>The last of these towns was F&acirc;staburgt in Ameland, temple
Foste, destroyed, according to Occa Scarlensis, in 806.</p>
<p>If we find among the Frisians a belief in a Godhead <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e511" href="#xd21e511" name=
"xd21e511">xx</a>]</span>and ideas of religion entirely different from
the Mythology of other nations, we are the more surprised to find in
some points the closest connection with the Greek and Roman Mythology,
and even with the origin of two deities of the highest rank, Min-erva
and Neptune. Min-erva (Ath&eacute;n&egrave;) was originally a
Burgtmaagd, priestess of Frya, at the town Walhallagara, Middelburg, or
Domburg, in Walcheren. And this Min-erva is at the same time the
mysterious enigmatical goddess of whose worship scarcely any traces
remain beyond the votive stones at Domburg, in Walcheren, Nehallenia,
of whom no mythology knows anything more than the name, which etymology
has used for all sorts of fantastical derivations.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e513src" href="#xd21e513" name="xd21e513src">2</a></p>
<p>The other, Neptune, called by the Etrurians Nethunus, the God of the
Mediterranean Sea, appears here to have been, when living, a Friesland
Viking, or sea-king, whose home was Alderga (Ouddorp, not far from
Alkmaar). His name was Teunis, called familiarly by his followers Neef
Teunis, or Cousin Teunis, who had chosen the Mediterranean as the
destination of his expeditions, and must have been deified by the
Tyrians at the time when the Phenician navigators began to extend their
voyages so remarkably, sailing to Friesland in order to obtain British
tin, northern iron, and amber from the Baltic, about 2000 years before
Christ.</p>
<p>Besides these two we meet with a third mythological
person&mdash;Minos, the lawgiver of Crete, who likewise appears to have
been a Friesland sea-king, Minno, born at Lindaoord, between Wieringen
and Kreyl, who imparted to the Cretans an &ldquo;Asagaboek.&rdquo; He
is that Minos who, with his brother Rhadamanthus and &AElig;acus,
presided as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e532" href="#xd21e532"
name="xd21e532">xxi</a>]</span>judges over the fates of the ghosts in
Hades, and must not be confounded with the later Minos, the
contemporary of &AElig;geus and Theseus, who appears in the Athenian
fables.</p>
<p>The reader may perhaps be inclined to laugh at these statements, and
apply to me the words that I myself have lately used, fantastic and
improbable. Indeed at first I could not believe my own eyes, and yet
after further consideration I arrived at the discovery of extraordinary
conformities which render the case much less improbable than the birth
of Min-erva from the head of Jupiter by a blow from the axe of
Heph&aelig;stus, for instance.</p>
<p>In the Greek Mythology all the gods and goddesses have a youthful
period. Pallas alone has no youth. She is not otherwise known than
adult. Min-erva appears in Attica as high priestess from a foreign
country, a country unknown to the Greeks. Pallas is a virgin goddess,
Min-erva is a Burgtmaagd. The fair, blue-eyed Pallas, differing thus in
type from the rest of the gods and goddesses, evidently belonged to
Frya&rsquo;s people. The character for wisdom and the emblematical
attributes, especially the owl, are the same for both. Pallas gives to
the new town her own name, Ath&egrave;nai, which has no meaning in
Greek. Min-erva gives to the town built by her the name Athene, which
has an important meaning in Fries, namely, that they came there as
friends&mdash;&ldquo;&Acirc;then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Min-erva came to Attica about 1600 years before Christ, the period
at which the Grecian Mythology was beginning to be formed. Min-erva
landed with the fleet of Jon at the head of a colony in Attica. In
later times we find her on the Roman votive stones in Walcheren, under
the name of Nehallenia, worshipped as a goddess of navigation; and
Pallas is worshipped by the Athenians as the protecting goddess of
shipbuilding and navigation.</p>
<p>Time is the carrier who must eternally turn the &ldquo;Jol&rdquo;
(wheel) and carry the sun along his course through the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e543" href="#xd21e543" name=
"xd21e543">xxii</a>]</span>firmament from winter to winter, thus
forming the year, every turn of the wheel being a day. In midwinter the
&ldquo;Jolfeest&rdquo; is celebrated on Frya&rsquo;s Day. Then cakes
are baked in the form of the sun&rsquo;s wheel, because with the Jol
Frya formed the letters when she wrote her &ldquo;Tex.&rdquo; The
Jolfeest is therefore also in honour of Frya as inventor of
writing.</p>
<p>Just as this Jolfeest has been changed by Christianity into
Christmas throughout Denmark and Germany, and into St Nicholas&rsquo;
Day in Holland; so, certainly, our St Nicholas&rsquo; dolls&mdash;the
lover and his sweetheart&mdash;are a memorial of Frya, and the St
Nicholas letters a memorial of Frya&rsquo;s invention of letters formed
from the wheel.</p>
<p>I cannot analyse the whole contents of this writing, and must
content myself with the remarks that I have made. They will give an
idea of the richness and importance of the contents. If some of it is
fabulous, even as fabulous it must have an interest for us, since so
little of the traditions of our forefathers remains to us.</p>
<p>An internal evidence of the antiquity of these writings may be found
in the fact that the name Batavians had not yet been used. The
inhabitants of the whole country as far as the Scheldt are Frya&rsquo;s
people&mdash;Frieslanders. The Batavians are not a separate people. The
name Batavi is of Roman origin. The Romans gave it to the inhabitants
of the banks of the Waal, which river bears the name Patabus in the
&ldquo;Tabula Pentingeriana.&rdquo; The name Batavi does not appear
earlier than Tacitus and Pliny, and is interpolated in
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bello Gallico,&rdquo; iv. 10. (See my
treatise on the course of the rivers through the countries of the
Frisians and Batavians, p. 49, in &ldquo;De Vrije Fries,&rdquo; 4th
vol. 1st part, 1845.)</p>
<p>I will conclude with one more remark regarding the language. Those
who have been able to take only a superficial <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e553" href="#xd21e553" name=
"xd21e553">xxiii</a>]</span>view of the manuscript have been struck by
the polish of the language, and its conformity with the present
Friesland language and Dutch. In this they seem to find grounds for
doubting the antiquity of the manuscript.</p>
<p>But, I ask, is, then, the language of Homer much less polished than
that of Plato or Demosthenes? And does not the greatest portion of
Homer&rsquo;s vocabulary exist in the Greek of our day?</p>
<p>It is true that language alters with time, and is continually
subject to slight variations, owing to which language is found to be
different at different epochs. This change in the language in this
manuscript accordingly gives ground for important observations to
philologists. It is not only that of the eight writers who have
successively worked at the book, each is recognisable by slight
peculiarities in style, language, and spelling; but more particularly
between the two parts of the book, between which an interval of more
than two centuries occurs, a striking difference of the language is
visible, which shows what a slowly progressive regulation it has
undergone in that period of time. As the result of these
considerations, I arrive at the conclusion that I cannot find any
reason to doubt the authenticity of these writings. They cannot be
forgeries. In the first place, the copy of 1256 cannot be. Who could at
that time have forged anything of that kind? Certainly no one. Still
less any one at an earlier date. At a later date a forgery is equally
impossible, for the simple reason that no one was acquainted with the
language. Except Grimm, Richthofen, and Hettema, no one can be named
sufficiently versed in that branch of philology, or who had studied the
language so as to be able to write in it. And if any one could have
done so, there would have been no more extensive vocabulary at his
service than that which the East Frisian laws afford. Therefore, in the
centuries lately elapsed, the preparation <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e559" href="#xd21e559" name="xd21e559">xxiv</a>]</span>of this
writing was quite impossible. Whoever doubts this let him begin by
showing where, when, by whom, and with what object such a forgery could
be committed, and let him show in modern times the fellow of this
paper, this writing, and this language.</p>
<p>Moreover, that the manuscript of 1256 is not original, but is a
copy, is proved by the numerous faults in the writing, as well as by
some explanations of words which already in the time of the copyist had
become obsolete and little known, as, for instance, in page 82 (114),
&ldquo;<span lang="fy-oer">to th&ecirc;ra fl&ecirc;te jefta
bedrum</span>;&rdquo; page 151 (204), &ldquo;<span lang="fy-oer">bargum
jefta tonnum fon tha besta bjar</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A still stronger proof is that between pages 157 and 158 one or more
pages are missing, which cannot have been lost out of this manuscript,
because the pages 157 and 158 are on the front and the back of the same
leaf.</p>
<p>Page 157 finishes thus: &ldquo;Three months afterwards Adel sent
messengers to all the friends that he had gained, and requested them to
send him intelligent people in the month of May.&rdquo; When we turn
over the leaf, the other side begins, &ldquo;his wife, he said, who had
been Maid of Texland, had got a copy of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no connection between these two. There is wanting, at
least, the arrival of the invited, and an account of what passed at
their meeting. It is clear, therefore, that the copyist must have
turned over two pages of the original instead of one. There certainly
existed then an earlier manuscript, and that was doubtless written by
Liko oera Linda in the year 803.</p>
<p>We may thus accept that we possess in this manuscript, of which the
first part was composed in the sixth century before our era, the oldest
production, after Homer and Hesiod, of European literature, And here we
find in our fatherland a very ancient people in possession of
development, <span class="corr" id="xd21e578" title=
"Source: civilisation">civilization</span>, industry, navigation,
commerce, literature, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e581" href=
"#xd21e581" name="xd21e581">xxv</a>]</span>and pure elevated ideas of
religion, whose existence we had never even conjectured. Hitherto we
have believed that the historical records of our people reach no
farther back than the arrival of Friso the presumptive founder of the
Frisians, whereas here we become aware that these records mount up to
more than 2000 years before Christ, surpassing the antiquity of Hellas
and equalling that of Israel.</p>

<p>Beloved successors, for the sake of our dear forefathers, and of our
dear liberty, I entreat you a thousand times never let the eye of a
monk look on these writings. They are very insinuating, but they
destroy in an underhand manner all that relates to us Frisians. In
order to gain rich benefices, they conspire with foreign kings, who
know that we are their greatest enemies, because we dare to speak to
their people of liberty, rights, and the duties of princes. Therefore
they seek to destroy all that we derive from our forefathers, and all
that is left of our old customs.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Book of Adela&rsquo;s Followers.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thirty years after the day on which the Volksmoeder
was murdered by the commander Magy, was a time of great distress. All
the states that lie on the other side of the Weser had been wrested
from us, and had fallen under the power of Magy, and it looked as if
his power was to become supreme over the whole land. To avert this
misfortune a general assembly of the people was summoned, which was
attended by all the men who stood in good repute with the Maagden
(priestesses). Then at the end of three days the whole council was in
confusion, and in the same position as when they came together.
Thereupon Adela demanded to be heard, and said:&mdash;</p>
<p>You all know that I was three years Burgtmaagd. You know also that I
was chosen for Volksmoeder, and that I refused to be Volksmoeder
because I wished to marry Apol; but what you do not know is, that I
have watched everything that has happened, as if I had really been your
Volksmoeder. I have constantly travelled about, observing what was
going on. By that means I have become acquainted with many things that
others do not know. You said yesterday that our relatives on the other
side of the Weser were dull and cowardly; but I may tell you that the
Magy has not won a single village from them by force of arms; but only
by detestable deceit, and still more by the rapacity of their dukes and
nobles.</p>
<p>Frya has said we must not admit amongst us any but free people; but
what have they done? They have imitated our enemies, and instead of
killing their prisoners, or letting them go free, they have despised
the counsel of Frya, and have made slaves of them.</p>
<p>Because they have acted thus, Frya cared no longer to watch over
them. They robbed others of their freedom, and therefore lost their
own. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e671" href="#xd21e671" name=
"xd21e671">7</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is well known to you, but I will tell you how they came to sink
so low. The Finn women had children. These grew up with our free
children. They played and gamboled together in the fields, and were
also together by the hearth.</p>
<p>There they learned with pleasure the loose ways of the Finns,
because they were bad and new; and thus they became denationalised in
spite of the efforts of their parents. When the children grew up, and
saw that the children of the Finns handled no weapons, and scarcely
worked, they took a distaste for work, and became proud.</p>
<p>The principal men and their cleverest sons made up to the wanton
daughters of the Finns; and their own daughters, led astray by this bad
example, allowed themselves to be beguiled by the handsome young Finns
in derision of their depraved fathers. When the Magy found this out, he
took the handsomest of his Finns and Magyars, and promised them
&ldquo;red cows with golden horns&rdquo; to let themselves be taken
prisoners by our people in order to spread his doctrines. His people
did even more. Children disappeared, were taken away to the uplands,
and after they had been brought up in his pernicious doctrines, were
sent back.</p>
<p>When these pretended prisoners had learned our language, they
persuaded the dukes and nobles that they should become subject to the
Magy&mdash;that then their sons would succeed to them without having to
be elected. Those who by their good deeds had gained a piece of land in
front of their house, they promised on their side should receive in
addition a piece behind; those who had got a piece before and behind,
should have a rondeel (complete circuit); and those who had a rondeel
should have a whole freehold. If the seniors were true to Frya, then
they changed their course, and turned to the degenerate sons. Yesterday
there were among you those who would have called the whole people
together, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e680" href="#xd21e680"
name="xd21e680">9</a>]</span>to compel the eastern states to return to
their duty. According to my humble opinion, they would have made a
great mistake. Suppose that there was a very serious epidemic among the
cattle, would you run the risk of sending your own healthy cattle among
the sick ones? Certainly not. Every one must see that doing that would
turn out very badly for the whole of the cattle. Who, then, would be so
imprudent as to send their children among a people wholly depraved? If
I were to give you any advice, it would be to choose a new Volksmoeder.
I know that you are in a difficulty about it, because out of the
thirteen Burgtmaagden that we still have remaining, eight are
candidates for the dignity; but I should pay no attention to that.</p>
<p>Teuntia, the Burgtmaagd of Medeasblik, who is not a candidate, is a
person of knowledge and sound sense, and quite as attached to our
people and our customs as all the rest together. I should farther
recommend that you should visit all the citadels, and write down all
the laws of Frya&rsquo;s Tex, as well as all the histories, and all
that is written on the walls, in order that it may not be destroyed
with the citadels.</p>
<p>It stands written that every Volksmoeder and every Burgtmaagd shall
have assistants and messengers&mdash;twenty-one maidens and seven
apprentices.</p>
<p>If I might add more, I would recommend that all the respectable
girls in the towns should be taught; for I say positively, and time
will show it, that if you wish to remain true children of Frya, never
to be vanquished by fraud or arms, you must take care to bring up your
daughters as true Frya&rsquo;s daughters.</p>
<p>You must teach the children how great our country has been, what
great men our forefathers were, how great we still are, if we compare
ourselves to others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e691" href=
"#xd21e691" name="xd21e691">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>You must tell them of the sea-heroes, of their mighty deeds and
distant voyages. All these stories must be told by the fireside and in
the field, wherever it may be, in times of joy or sorrow; and if you
wish to impress it on the brains and the hearts of your sons, you must
let it flow through the lips of your wives and your daughters.</p>
<p>Adela&rsquo;s advice was followed.</p>
<p>These are the Grevetmen under whose direction this book is
composed:&mdash;</p>
<p>Apol, Adela&rsquo;s husband; three times a sea-king; Grevetman of
Ostflyland and Lindaoorden. The towns Liudgarda, Lindahem, and Stavia
are under his care.</p>
<p>The Saxman Storo, Sytia&rsquo;s husband; Grevetman over the
Hoogefennen and Wouden. Nine times he was chosen as duke or heerman
(commander). The towns Buda and Manna-garda-forda are under his
care.</p>
<p>Ab&ecirc;lo, Jaltia&rsquo;s husband; Grevetman over the
Zuiderfly-landen. He was three times heerman. The towns Aken, Liudburg,
and Katsburg are under his care.</p>
<p>Enoch, Dywcke&rsquo;s husband; Grevetman over Westflyland and Texel.
He was chosen nine times for sea-king. Waraburg, Medeasblik, Forana,
and Fryasburg are under his care.</p>
<p>Foppe, Dunroo&rsquo;s husband; Grevetman over the seven islands. He
was five times sea-king. The town Walhallagara is under his care.</p>
<p>This was inscribed upon the walls of Fryasburg in Texland, as well
as at Stavia and Medeasblik.</p>
<p>It was Frya&rsquo;s day, and seven times seven years had elapsed
since Festa was appointed Volksmoeder by the desire of Frya. The
citadel of Medeasblik was ready, and a Burgtmaagd was chosen. Festa was
about to light her new lamp, and when she had done so in the presence
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e713" href="#xd21e713" name=
"xd21e713">13</a>]</span>of all the people, Frya called from her
watch-star, so that every one could hear it: &ldquo;Festa, take your
style and write the things, that I may not speak.&rdquo; Festa did as
she was bid, and thus we became Frya&rsquo;s children, and our earliest
history began.</p>
<p>This is our earliest history.</p>
<p>Wr-alda, who alone is eternal and good, made the beginning. Then
commenced time. Time wrought all things, even the earth. The earth bore
grass, herbs, and trees, all useful and all noxious animals. All that
is good and useful she brought forth by day, and all that is bad and
injurious by night.</p>
<p>After the twelfth Juulfeest she brought forth three
maidens:&mdash;</p>
<p>Lyda out of fierce heat.</p>
<p>Finda out of strong heat.</p>
<p>Frya out of moderate heat.</p>
<p>When the last came into existence, Wr-alda breathed his spirit upon
her in order that men might be bound to him. As soon as they were full
grown they took pleasure and delight in the visions of Wr-alda.</p>
<p>Hatred found its way among them.</p>
<p>They each bore twelve sons and twelve daughters&mdash;at every
Juul-time a couple. Thence come all mankind.</p>
<p>Lyda was black, with hair curled like a lamb&rsquo;s; her eyes shone
like stars, and shot out glances like those of a bird of prey.</p>
<p>Lyda was acute. She could hear a snake glide, and could smell a fish
in the water.</p>
<p>Lyda was strong and nimble. She could bend a large tree, yet when
she walked she did not bruise a flower-stalk.</p>
<p>Lyda was violent. Her voice was loud, and when she screamed in anger
every creature quailed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e742" href=
"#xd21e742" name="xd21e742">15</a>]</span></p>
<p>Wonderful Lyda! She had no regard for laws; her actions were
governed by her passions. To help the weak she would kill the strong,
and when she had done it she would weep by their bodies.</p>
<p>Poor Lyda! She turned grey by her mad behaviour, and at last she
died heart-broken by the wickedness of her children. Foolish children!
They accused each other of their mother&rsquo;s death. They howled and
fought like wolves, and while they did this the birds devoured the
corpse. Who can refrain from tears at such a recital?</p>
<p>Finda was yellow, and her hair was like the mane of a horse. She
could not bend a tree, but where Lyda killed one lion she killed
ten.</p>
<p>Finda was seductive. Her voice was sweeter than any bird&rsquo;s.
Her eyes were alluring and enticing, but whoever looked upon them
became her slave.</p>
<p>Finda was unreasonable. She wrote thousands of laws, but she never
obeyed one. She despised the frankness of the good, and gave herself up
to flatterers.</p>
<p>That was her misfortune. Her head was too full, but her heart was
too vain. She loved nobody but herself, and she wished that all should
love her.</p>
<p>False Finda! Honey-sweet were her words, but those who trusted them
found sorrow at hand.</p>
<p>Selfish Finda! She wished to rule everybody, and her sons were like
her. They made their sisters serve them, and they slew each other for
the mastery.</p>
<p>Treacherous Finda! One wrong word would irritate her, and the
cruellest deeds did not affect her. If she saw a lizard swallow a
spider, she shuddered; but if she saw her children kill a Frisian, her
bosom swelled with pleasure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e762"
href="#xd21e762" name="xd21e762">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>Unfortunate Finda! She died in the bloom of her age, and the mode of
her death is unknown.</p>
<p>Hypocritical children! Her corpse was buried under a costly stone,
pompous inscriptions were written on it, and loud lamentations were
heard at it, but in private not a tear was shed.</p>
<p>Despicable people! The laws that Finda established were written on
golden tables, but the object for which they were made was never
attained. The good laws were abolished, and selfishness instituted bad
ones in their place. O Finda! then the earth overflowed with blood, and
your children were mown down like grass. Yes, Finda! those were the
fruits of your vanity. Look down from your watch-star and weep.</p>
<p>Frya was white like the snow at sunrise, and the blue of her eyes
vied with the rainbow.</p>
<p>Beautiful Frya! Like the rays of the sun shone the locks of her
hair, which were as fine as spiders&rsquo; webs.</p>
<p>Clever Frya! When she opened her lips the birds ceased to sing and
the leaves to quiver.</p>
<p>Powerful Frya! At the glance of her eye the lion lay down at her
feet and the adder withheld his poison.</p>
<p>Pure Frya! Her food was honey, and her beverage was dew gathered
from the cups of the flowers.</p>
<p>Sensible Frya! The first lesson that she taught her children was
self-control, and the second was the love of virtue; and when they were
grown she taught them the value of liberty; for she said,
&ldquo;Without liberty all other virtues serve to make you slaves, and
to disgrace your origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Generous Frya! She never allowed metal to be dug from the earth for
her own benefit, but when she did it it was for the general use.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e783" href="#xd21e783" name=
"xd21e783">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>Most happy Frya! Like the starry host in the firmament, her children
clustered around her.</p>
<p>Wise Frya! When she had seen her children reach the seventh
generation, she summoned them all to Flyland, and there gave them her
Tex, saying, &ldquo;Let this be your guide, and it can never go ill
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exalted Frya! When she had thus spoken the earth shook like the sea
of Wr-alda. The ground of Flyland sunk beneath her feet, the air was
dimmed by tears, and when they looked for their mother she was already
risen to her watching star; then at length thunder burst from the
clouds, and the lightning wrote upon the firmament
&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far-seeing Frya! The land from which she had risen was now a stream,
and except her Tex all that was in it was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Obedient children! When they came to themselves again, they made
this high mound and built this citadel upon it, and on the walls they
wrote the Tex, and that every one should be able to find it they called
the land about it Texland. Therefore it shall remain as long as the
earth shall be the earth.</p>

<p class="first">Prosperity awaits the free. At last they shall see me
again. <span class="corr" id="xd21e800" title=
"Source: Though">Through</span> him only can I recognise as free who is
neither a slave to another nor to himself. This is my
counsel:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. When in dire distress, and when mental and physical energy avail
nothing, then have recourse to the spirit of Wr-alda; but do not appeal
to him before you have tried all other means, for I tell you
beforehand, and time will prove its truth, that those who give way to
discouragement sink under their burdens. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e805" href="#xd21e805" name="xd21e805">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>2. To Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit only shall you bend the knee in
gratitude&mdash;thricefold&mdash;for what you have received, for what
you do receive, and for the hope of aid in time of need.</p>
<p>3. You have seen how speedily I have come to your assistance. Do
likewise to your neighbour, but wait not for his entreaties. The
suffering would curse you, my maidens would erase your name from the
book, and I would regard you as a stranger.</p>
<p>4. Let not your neighbour express his thanks to you on bended knee,
which is only due to Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit. Envy would assail you,
Wisdom would ridicule you, and my maidens would accuse you of
irreverence.</p>
<p>5. Four things are given for your enjoyment&mdash;air, water, land,
and fire&mdash;but Wr-alda is the sole possessor of them. Therefore my
counsel to you is, choose upright men who will fairly divide the labour
and the fruits, so that no man shall be exempt from work or from the
duty of defence.</p>
<p>6. If ever it should happen that one of your people should sell his
freedom, he is not of you, he is a bastard. I counsel you to expel him
and his mother from the land. Repeat this to your children morning,
noon, and night, till they think of it in their dreams.</p>
<p>7. If any man shall deprive another, even his debtor, of his
liberty, let him be to you as a vile slave; and I advise you to burn
his body and that of his mother in an open place, and bury them fifty
feet below the ground, so that no grass shall grow upon them. It would
poison your cattle.</p>
<p>8. Meddle not with the people of Lyda, nor of Finda, because Wr-alda
would help them, and any injury that you inflicted on them would recoil
upon your own heads. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e820" href=
"#xd21e820" name="xd21e820">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>9. If it should happen that they come to you for advice or
assistance, then it behoves you to help them; but if they should rob
you, then fall upon them with fire and sword.</p>
<p>10. If any of them should seek a daughter of yours to wife, and she
is willing, explain to her her folly; but if she will follow her lover,
let her go in peace.</p>
<p>11. If your son wishes for a daughter of theirs, do the same as to
your daughter; but let not either one or the other ever return among
you, for they would introduce foreign morals and customs, and if these
were accepted by you, I could no longer watch over you.</p>
<p>12. Upon my servant Fasta I have placed all my hopes. Therefore you
must choose her for Eeremoeder. Follow my advice, then she will
hereafter remain my servant as well as all the sacred maidens who
succeed her. Then shall the lamp which I have lighted for you never be
extinguished. Its brightness shall always illuminate your intellect,
and you shall always remain as free from foreign domination as your
fresh river-water is distinct from the salt sea.</p>

respect them all. If by force or necessity any regulations should be
imposed upon us at variance with our laws and customs, we must submit;

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">These are the Laws Established for the Government of
the Citadels.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. Whenever a citadel is built, the lamp belonging to
it must be lighted at the original lamp in Texland, and that can only
be done by the mother.</p>
<p>2. Every mother shall appoint her own maidens. She may even choose
those who are mothers in other towns.</p>
<p>3. The mother of Texland may appoint her own successor, but should
she die without having done so, the election shall take place at a
general assembly of the whole nation.</p>
<p>4. The mother of Texland may have twenty-one maidens and seven
assistants, so that there may always be seven to attend the lamp day
and night. She may have the same number of maidens who are mothers in
other towns.</p>
<p>5. If a maiden wishes to marry, she must announce it to the mother,
and immediately resign her office, before her passion shall have
polluted the light.</p>
<p>6. For the service of the mother and of each of the Burgtmaidens
there shall be appointed twenty-one townsmen&mdash;seven civilians of
mature years, seven warriors of mature years, and seven seamen of
mature years. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e857" href="#xd21e857"
name="xd21e857">27</a>]</span></p>
<p>7. Out of the seven three shall retire every year, and shall not be
replaced by members of their own family nearer than the fourth
degree.</p>
<p>8. Each may have three hundred young townsmen as defenders.</p>
<p>9. For this service they must study Frya&rsquo;s Tex and the laws.
From the sages they must learn wisdom, from the warriors the art of
war, and from the sea-kings the skill required for distant voyages.</p>
<p>10. Every year one hundred of the defenders shall return to their
homes, and those that may have been wounded shall remain in the
citadels.</p>
<p>11. At the election of the defenders no burgher or Grevetman, or
other person of distinction, shall vote, but only the people.</p>
<p>12. The mother at Texland shall have three times seven active
messengers, and three times twelve speedy horses. In the other citadels
each maiden shall have three messengers and seven horses.</p>
<p>13. Every citadel shall have fifty agriculturists chosen by the
people, but only those may be chosen who are not strong enough to go to
war or to go to sea.</p>
<p>14. Every citadel must provide for its own sustenance, and must
maintain its own defences, and look after its share of the general
contributions.</p>
<p>15. If a man is chosen to fill any office and refuses to serve, he
can never become a burgher, nor have any vote. And if he is already a
burgher, he shall cease to be so.</p>
<p>16. If any man wishes to consult the mother or a Burgtmaid, he must
apply to the secretary, who will take him to the Burgtmaster. He will
then be examined by a surgeon to see if he is in good health. If he is
passed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e879" href="#xd21e879" name=
"xd21e879">29</a>]</span>he shall lay aside his arms, and seven
warriors shall present him to the mother.</p>
<p>17. If the affair concerns only one district, he must bring forward
not less than three witnesses; but if it affects the whole of
Friesland, he must have twenty-one additional witnesses, in order to
guard against any deceptions.</p>
<p>18. Under all circumstances the mother must take care that her
children, that is, Frya&rsquo;s people, shall remain as temperate as
possible. This is her most important duty, and it is the duty of all of
us to help her in performing it.</p>
<p>19. If she is called upon to decide any judicial question between a
Grevetman and the community, she must incline towards the side of the
community in order to maintain peace, and because it is better that one
man should suffer than many.</p>
<p>20. If any one comes to the mother for advice, and she is prepared
to give it, she must do it immediately. If she does not know what to
advise, he must remain waiting seven days; and if she then is unable to
advise, he must go away without complaining, for it is better to have
no advice at all than bad advice.</p>
<p>21. If a mother shall have given bad advice out of <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e891" title="Source: illwill">ill will</span>, she must
be killed or driven out of the land, deprived of everything.</p>
<p>22. If her Burgtheeren are accomplices, they are to be treated in a
similar manner.</p>
<p>23. If her guilt is doubtful or only suspected, it must be
considered and debated, if necessary, for twenty-one weeks. If half the
votes are against her, she must be declared innocent. If two-thirds are
against her, she must wait a whole year. If the votes are then the
same, she must be considered guilty, but may not be put to death.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e899" href="#xd21e899" name=
"xd21e899">31</a>]</span></p>
<p>24. If any of the one-third who have voted for her wish to go away
with her, they may depart with all their live and dead stock, and shall
not be the less considered, since the majority may be wrong as well as
the minority.</p>

<h2 class="main">Universal Law.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. All free-born men are equal, wherefore they must
all have equal rights on sea and land, and on all that Wr-alda has
given.</p>
<p>2. Every man may seek the wife of his choice, and every woman may
bestow her hand on him whom she loves.</p>
<p>3. When a man takes a wife, a house and yard must be given to him.
If there is none, one must be built for him.</p>
<p>4. If he has taken a wife in another village, and wishes to remain,
they must give him a house there, and likewise the free use of the
common.</p>
<p>5. To every man must be given a piece of land behind his house. No
man shall have land in front of his house, still less an enclosure,
unless he has performed some public service. In such a case it may be
given, and the youngest son may inherit it, but after him it returns to
the community.</p>
<p>6. Every village shall possess a common for the general good, and
the chief of the village shall take care that it is kept in good order,
so that posterity shall find it uninjured.</p>
<p>7. Every village shall have a market-place. All the rest of the land
shall be for tillage and forest. No one shall fell trees without the
consent of the community, or without the knowledge of the forester; for
the forests are general property, and no man can appropriate them.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e919" href="#xd21e919" name=
"xd21e919">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>8. The market charges shall not exceed one-twelfth of the value of
the goods either to natives or strangers. The portion taken for the
charges shall not be sold before the other goods.</p>
<p>9. All the market receipts must be divided yearly into a hundred
parts three days before the Juul-day.</p>
<p>10. The Grevetman and his council shall take twenty parts; the
keeper of the market ten, and his assistants five; the Volksmoeder one,
the midwife four, the village ten, and the poor and infirm shall have
fifty parts.</p>
<p>11. There shall be no usurers in the market.</p>
<p>If any should come, it will be the duty of the maidens to make it
known through the whole land, in order that such people may not be
chosen for any office, because they are hard-hearted.</p>
<p>For the sake of money they would betray everybody&mdash;the people,
the mother, their nearest relations, and even their own selves.</p>
<p>12. If any man should attempt to sell diseased cattle or damaged
goods for sound, the market-keeper shall expel him, and the maidens
shall proclaim him through the country.</p>
<p>In early times almost all the Finns lived together in their native
land, which was called Aldland, and is now submerged. They were thus
far away, and we had no wars. When they were driven hitherwards, and
appeared as robbers, then arose the necessity of defending ourselves,
and we had armies, kings, and wars.</p>
<p>For all this there were established regulations, and out of the
regulations came fixed laws.</p>

<p class="first">1. Every Frisian must resist the assailants with such
weapons as he can procure, invent, and use. <span class=

"xd21e944">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>2. When a boy is twelve years old he must devote one day in seven to
learning how to use his weapons.</p>
<p>3. As soon as he is perfect in the use of them they are to be given
to him, and he is to be admitted as a warrior.</p>
<p>4. After serving as a warrior three years, he may become a citizen,
and may have a vote in the election of the headman.</p>
<p>5. When he has been seven years a voter he then may have a vote for
the chief or king, and may be himself elected.</p>
<p>6. Every year he must be re-elected.</p>
<p>7. Except the king, all other officials are re-eligible who act
according to Frya&rsquo;s laws.</p>
<p>8. No king may be in office more than three years, in order that the
office may not be permanent.</p>
<p>9. After an interval of seven years he may be elected again.</p>
<p>10. If the king is killed by the enemy, his nearest relative may be
a candidate to succeed him.</p>
<p>11. If he dies a natural death, or if his period of service has
expired, he shall not be succeeded by any blood relation nearer than
the fourth degree.</p>
<p>12. Those who fight with arms are not men of counsel, therefore no
king must bear arms. His wisdom must be his weapon, and the love of his
warriors his shield.</p>

<h2 class="main">These are the Rights of the Mothers and the
Kings.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. If war breaks out, the mother sends her messengers
to the king, who sends messengers to the Grevetmen to call the citizens
to arms.</p>
<p>2. The Grevetmen call all the citizens together and decide how many
men shall be sent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e975" href=

<p>3. All the resolutions must immediately be sent to the mother by
messengers and witnesses.</p>
<p>4. The mother considers all the resolutions and decides upon them,
and with this the king as well as the people must be satisfied.</p>
<p>5. When in the field, the king consults only his superior officers,
but three citizens of the mother must be present, without any voice.
These citizens must send daily reports to the mother, that they may be
sure nothing is done contrary to the counsels of Frya.</p>
<p>6. If the king wishes to do anything which his council opposes, he
may not persist in it.</p>
<p>7. If an enemy appears unexpectedly, then the king&rsquo;s orders
must be obeyed.</p>
<p>8. If the king is not present, the next to him takes command, and so
on in succession according to rank.</p>
<p>9. If there is no leader present, one must be chosen.</p>
<p>10. If there is no time to choose, any one may come forward who
feels himself capable of leading.</p>
<p>11. If a king has conquered a dangerous enemy, his successors may
take his name after their own. The king may, if he wishes, choose an
open piece of ground for a house and ground; the ground shall be
enclosed, and may be so large that there shall be seven hundred steps
to the boundary in all directions from the house.</p>

son after him; then it shall return to the community.</p>

be assessed on the people to make it good again, so that no one may
neglect the general welfare to preserve his own interest.</p>
<p>3. At the conclusion of a war, if any men are so severely wounded as

and shall have the best seats at festivals, in order that the young may
learn to honour them.</p>
<p>4. If there are widows and orphans, they shall likewise be
maintained at the public expense; and the sons may inscribe the names
of their fathers on their shields for the honour of their families.</p>
<p>5. If any who have been taken prisoners should return, they must be
kept separate from the camp, because they may have obtained their
liberty by making treacherous promises, and thus they may avoid keeping
their promises without forfeiting their honour.</p>
<p>6. If any enemies be taken prisoners, they must be sent to the
interior of the country, that they may learn our free customs.</p>

may offer himself as a navigator to the Olderman, who may not refuse
him as long as there is any vacancy.</p>
<p>2. The navigators may choose their own masters.</p>
<p>3. The traders must be chosen and named by the community to which
they belong, and the navigators have no voice in their election.</p>
<p>4. If during a voyage it is found that the king is bad or
incompetent, another may be put in his place, and on the return home he
may make his complaint to the Olderman.</p>
<p>5. If the fleet returns with profits, the sailors may divide
one-third among themselves in the following manner: The king twelve
portions, the admiral seven, the boatswains each two portions, the
captains three, and the rest of the crew each one part; the youngest
boys each one-third of a portion, the second boys half a portion each,

their portion.</p>

the names of their fathers on their shields.</p>
<p>9. If a topsailman is lost, his heirs shall receive a whole
portion.</p>
<p>10. If he was betrothed, his bride may claim seven portions in order
to erect a monument to her bridegroom, but then she must remain a widow
all her life.</p>
<p>11. If the community is fitting out a fleet, the purveyors must
provide the best provisions for the voyage, and for the women and
children.</p>

one must be given him. If he does not wish for a house, his friends may
take him home; and the community must bear the expense, unless his

land, and they request us to arbitrate, our best course will be to
decline; but if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1068" href=
"#xd21e1068" name="xd21e1068">45</a>]</span>they insist upon it, it
must be done honourably and justly.</p>
<p>If any one comes and says, I am at war, you must help me; or another
comes and says, My son is an infant and incompetent, and I am old, so I
wish you to be his guardian, and to take charge of my property until he
is of age, it is proper to refuse in order that we may not come into
disputes about matters foreign to our free customs.</p>
<p>Whenever a foreign trader comes to the open markets at Wyringen and
Almanland, if he cheats, he must immediately be fined, and it must be
published by the maidens throughout the whole country.</p>
<p>If he should come back, no one must deal with him. He must return as
he came.</p>
<p>Whenever traders are chosen to go to trading stations, or to sail
with the fleets, they must be well known and of good reputation with
the maidens.</p>
<p>If, however, a bad man should by chance be chosen and should try to
cheat, the others are bound to remove him. If he should have committed
a cheat, it must be made good, and the culprit must be banished from
the land in order that our name may be everywhere held in honour.</p>
<p>If we should be ill-treated in a foreign market, whether distant or
near, we must immediately attack them; for though we desire to be at
peace, we must not let our neighbours underrate us or think that we are
afraid.</p>
<p>In my youth I often grumbled at the strictness of the laws, but
afterwards I learned to thank Frya for her Tex and our forefathers for
the laws which they established upon it. Wr-alda or Alvader has given
me many years, and I have travelled over many lands and seas, and after
all that I have seen, I am convinced that we alone <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1084" href="#xd21e1084" name=
"xd21e1084">47</a>]</span>are chosen by Alvader to have laws.
Lyda&rsquo;s people can neither make laws nor obey them, they are too
stupid and uncivilised. Many are like Finda. They are clever enough,
but they are too rapacious, haughty, false, immoral, and
bloodthirsty.</p>
<p>The toad blows himself out, but he can only crawl. The frog cries
&ldquo;Work, work;&rdquo; but he can do nothing but hop and make
himself ridiculous. The raven cries &ldquo;Spare, spare;&rdquo; but he
steals and wastes everything that he gets into his beak.</p>
<p>Finda&rsquo;s people are just like these. They say a great deal
about making good laws, and every one wishes to make regulations
against misconduct, but does not wish to submit to them himself.
Whoever is the most crafty crows over the others, and tries to make
them submit to him, till another comes who drives him off his
perch.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;Eva&rdquo; is too sacred for common use, therefore
men have learned to say &ldquo;Evin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eva&rdquo; means that sentiment which is implanted in the
breast of every man in order that he may know what is right and what is
wrong, and by which he is able to judge his own deeds and those of
others; that is, if he has been well and properly brought up.
&ldquo;Eva&rdquo; has also another meaning; that is, tranquil, smooth,
like water that is not stirred by a breath of wind. If the water is
disturbed it becomes troubled, uneven, but it always has a tendency to
return to its tranquil condition. That is its nature, just as the
inclination towards justice and freedom exists in Frya&rsquo;s
children. We derive this disposition from the spirit of our father
Wr-alda, which speaks strongly in Frya&rsquo;s children, and will
eternally remain so. Eternity is another symbol of Wr-alda, who remains
always just and unchangeable.</p>
<p>Eternal and unalterable are the signs wisdom and rectitude,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1097" href="#xd21e1097" name=
"xd21e1097">49</a>]</span>which must be sought after by all pious
people, and must be possessed by all judges. If, therefore, it is
desired to make laws and regulations which shall be permanent, they
must be equal for all men. The judges must pronounce their decisions
according to these laws. If any crime is committed respecting which no
law has been made, a general assembly of the people shall be called,
where judgment shall be pronounced in accordance with the inspiration
of Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit. If we act thus, our judgment will never fail
to be right.</p>
<p>If instead of doing right, men will commit wrong, there will arise
quarrels and differences among people and states. Thence arise civil
wars, and everything is thrown into confusion and destroyed; and, O
foolish people! while you are injuring each other the spiteful
Finda&rsquo;s people with their false priests come and attack your
ports, ravish your daughters, corrupt your morals, and at last throw
the bonds of slavery over every freeman&rsquo;s neck.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Nyhalennia, whose real name was Min-erva, was
well established, and the Krekalanders loved her as well as our own
people did, there came some princes and priests to her citadel and
asked Min-erva, where her possessions lay. Hellenia answered, I carry
my possessions in my own bosom. What I have inherited is the love of
wisdom, justice, and freedom. If I lose these I shall become as the
least of your slaves; now I give advice for nothing, but then I should
sell it. The gentlemen went away laughing and saying, Your humble
servants, wise Hellenia. But they missed their object, for the people
took up this name as a name of honour. When they saw that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1106" href="#xd21e1106" name=
"xd21e1106">51</a>]</span>their shot had missed they began to
calumniate her, and to say that she had bewitched the people; but our
people and the good Krekalanders understood at once that it was
calumny. She was once asked, If you are not a witch, what is the use of
the eggs that you always carry with you? Min-erva answered, These eggs
are the symbols of Frya&rsquo;s counsels, in which our future and that
of the whole human race lies concealed. Time will hatch them, and we
must watch that no harm happens to them. The priests said, Well
answered; but what is the use of the dog on your right hand? Hellenia
replied, Does not the shepherd have a sheep-dog to keep his flock
together? What the dog is to the shepherd I am in Frya&rsquo;s service.
I must watch over Frya&rsquo;s flocks. We understand that very well,
said the priests; but tell us what means the owl that always sits upon
your head, is that light-shunning animal a sign of your clear vision?
No, answered Hellenia; he reminds me that there are people on earth
who, like him, have their homes in churches and holes, who go about in
the twilight, not, like him, to deliver us from mice and other plagues,
but to invent tricks to steal away the knowledge of other people, in
order to take advantage of them, to make slaves of them, and to suck
their blood like leeches. Another time they came with a whole troop of
people, when the plague was in the country, and said: We are all making
offerings to the gods that they may take away the plague. Will you not
help to turn away their anger, or have you yourself brought the plague
into the land with all your arts? No, said Min-erva; I know no gods
that do evil, therefore I cannot ask them to do better. I only know one
good spirit, that is Wr-alda&rsquo;s; and as he is good he never does
evil. Where, then, does evil come from? asked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1108" href="#xd21e1108" name=
"xd21e1108">53</a>]</span>the priests. All the evil comes from you, and
from the stupidity of the people who let themselves be deceived by you.
If, then, your god is so exceedingly good, why does he not turn away
the bad? asked the priests. Hellenia answered: Frya has placed us here,
and the carrier, that is, Time, must do the rest. For all calamities
there is counsel and remedy to be found, but Wr-alda wills that we
should search it out ourselves, in order that we may become strong and
wise. If we will not do that, he leaves us to our own devices, in order
that we may experience the results of wise or foolish conduct. Then a
prince said, I should think it best to submit. Very possibly, answered
Hellenia; for then men would be like sheep, and you and the priests
would take care of them, shearing them and leading them to the
shambles. This is what our god does not desire, he desires that we
should help one another, but that all should be free and wise. That is
also our desire, and therefore our people choose their princes, counts,
councillors, chiefs, and masters among the wisest of the good men, in
order that every man shall do his best to be wise and good. Thus doing,
we learn ourselves and teach the people that being wise and acting
wisely can alone lead to holiness. That seems very good judgment, said
the priests; but if you mean that the plague is caused by our
stupidity, then Nyhellenia will perhaps be so good as to bestow upon us
a little of that new light of which she is so proud. Yes, said
Hellenia, but ravens and other birds of prey feed only on dead carrion,
whereas the plague feeds not only on carrion but on bad laws and
customs and wicked passions. If you wish the plague to depart from you
and not return, you must put away your bad passions and become pure
within and without. We admit that the advice is good, said the priests,
but how shall we induce all the people under our rule <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1110" href="#xd21e1110" name=
"xd21e1110">55</a>]</span>to agree to it? Then Hellenia stood up and
said: The sparrows follow the sower, and the people their good princes,
therefore it becomes you to begin by rendering yourselves pure, so that
you may look within and without, and not be ashamed of your own
conduct. Now, instead of purifying the people, you have invented foul
festivals, in which they have so long revelled that they wallow like
swine in the mire to atone for your evil passions. The people began to
mock and to jeer, so that she did not dare to pursue the subject; and
one would have thought that they would have called all the people
together to drive us out of the land; but no, in place of abusing her
they went all about from the heathenish Krekaland to the Alps,
proclaiming that it had pleased the Almighty God to send his clever
daughter Min-erva, surnamed Nyhellenia, over the sea in a cloud to give
people good counsel, and that all who listened to her should become
rich and happy, and in the end governors of all the kingdoms of the
earth. They erected statues to her on all their altars, they announced
and sold to the simple people advice that she had never given, and
related miracles that she had never performed. They cunningly made
themselves masters of our laws and customs, and by craft and subtlety
were able to explain and spread them around. They appointed priestesses
under their own care, who were apparently under the protection of
Festa, our first Eeremoeder, to watch over the holy lamp; but that lamp
they lit themselves, and instead of imbuing the priestesses with
wisdom, and then sending them to watch the sick and educate the young,
they made them stupid and ignorant, and never allowed them to come out.
They were employed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1112" href=
"#xd21e1112" name="xd21e1112">57</a>]</span>as advisers, but the advice
which seemed to come from them was but the repetition of the behests of
the priests. When Nyhellenia died, we wished to choose another mother,
and some of us wished to go to Texland to look for her; but the
priests, who were all-powerful among their own people, would not permit
it, and accused us before the people of being unholy.</p>

<p class="first">When I came away from Athenia with my followers, we
arrived at an island named by my crew Kreta, because of the cries that
the inhabitants raised on our arrival. When they really saw that we did
not come to make war, they were quiet, so that at last I was able to
buy a harbour in exchange for a boat and some iron implements, and a
piece of land. When we had been settled there a short time, and they
discovered that we had no slaves, they were very much astonished; and
when I explained to them that we had laws which made everybody equal,
they wished to have the same; but they had hardly established them
before the whole land was in confusion.</p>
<p>The priests and the princes declared that we had excited their
subjects to rebellion, and the people appealed to us for aid and
protection. When the princes saw that they were about to lose their
kingdom, they gave freedom to their people, and came to me to establish
a code of laws. The people, however, got no freedom, and the princes
remained masters, acting according to their own pleasure. When this
storm had passed, they began to sow divisions among us. They told my
people that I had invoked their assistance to make myself permanent
king. Once I found poison in my food. So when a ship from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1121" href="#xd21e1121" name=

departure. Leaving alone, then, my own adventures, I will conclude this
history by saying that we must not have anything to do with
Finda&rsquo;s people, wherever it may be, because they are full of
false tricks, fully as much to be feared as their sweet wine with
deadly poison.</p>

<h2 class="main">These are the Three Principles on which these Laws are
Founded.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. Everybody knows that he requires the necessaries of
life, and if he cannot obtain them he does not know how to preserve his
life.</p>
<p>2. All men have a natural desire to have children, and if it is not
satisfied they are not aware what evil may spring from it.</p>
<p>3. Every man knows that he wishes to live free and undisturbed, and
that others wish the same thing.</p>
<p>To secure this, these laws and regulations are made.</p>
<p>The people of Finda have also their rules and regulations, but these
are not made according to what is just&mdash;only for the advantage of
priests and princes&mdash;therefore their states are full of disputes
and murder.</p>
<p>1. If any man falls into a state of destitution, his case must be
brought before the count by the maidens, because a high-minded Frisian
cannot bear to do that himself.</p>
<p>2. If any man becomes poor because he will not work, he must be sent
out of the country, because the cowardly and lazy are troublesome and
ill-disposed, therefore they ought to be got rid of.</p>
<p>3. Every young man ought to seek a bride and to be married at
five-and-twenty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1144" href=
"#xd21e1144" name="xd21e1144">61</a>]</span></p>
<p>4. If a young man is not married at five-and-twenty, he must be
driven from his home, and the younger men must avoid him. If then he
will not marry, he must be declared dead, and leave the country, so
that he may not give offence.</p>
<p>5. If a man is impotent, he must openly declare that no one has
anything to fear from him, then he may come or go where he likes.</p>
<p>6. If after that he commits any act of incontinence, then he must
flee away; if he does not, he may be given over to the vengeance of
those whom he has offended, and no one may aid him.</p>
<p>7. Any one who commits a theft shall restore it threefold. For a
second offence he shall be sent to the tin mines. The person robbed may
forgive him if he pleases, but for a third offence no one shall protect
him.</p>

<h2 class="main">These Rules are Made for Angry People.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. If a man in a passion or out of <span class="corr"
id="xd21e1159" title="Source: illwill">ill will</span> breaks
another&rsquo;s limb or puts out an eye or a tooth, he must pay
whatever the injured man demands. If he cannot pay, he must suffer the
same injury as he has done to the other. If he refuses this, he must
appeal to the Burgtmaagd in order to be sent to work in the iron or tin
mines until he has expiated his crime under the general law.</p>
<p>2. If a man is so wicked as to kill a Frisian, he must forfeit his
own life; but if the Burgtmaagd can send him to the tin mines for his
life before he is taken, she may do so.</p>
<p>3. If the prisoner can prove by proper witnesses that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1166" href="#xd21e1166" name=
"xd21e1166">63</a>]</span>the death was accidental, he may go free; but
if it happens a second time, he must go to the tin mines, in order to
avoid any unseemly hatred or vengeance.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">These are the Rules Concerning Bastards.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. If any man sets fire to another&rsquo;s house, he
is no Frisian, he is a bastard. If he is caught in the act, he must be
thrown into the fire; and wherever he may flee, he shall never be
secure from the avenging justice.</p>
<p>2. No true Frisian shall speak ill of the faults of his neighbours.
If any man injures himself, but does no harm to others, he must be his
own judge; but if he becomes so bad that he is dangerous to others,
they must bring it before the count. But if instead of going to the
count a man accuses another behind his back, he must be put on the
pillory in the market-place, and then sent out of the country, but not
to the tin mines, because even there a backbiter is to be feared.</p>
<p>3. If any man should prove a traitor and show to our enemies the
paths leading to our places of refuge, or creep into them by night, he
must be the offspring of Finda; he must be burnt. The sailors must take
his mother and all his relations to a desolate island, and there
scatter his ashes, in order that no poisonous herbs may spring from
them. The maidens must curse his name in all the states, in order that
no child may be called by his name, and that his ancestors may
repudiate him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1177" href=
"#xd21e1177" name="xd21e1177">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>War had come to an end, but famine came in its place. There were
three men who each stole a sack of corn from different owners, but they
were all caught. The first owner brought his thief to the judge, and
the maidens said everywhere that he had done right. The second owner
took the corn away from his thief and let him go in peace. The maidens
said he has done well. The third owner went to the thief&rsquo;s house,
and when he saw what misery was there, he went and brought a
waggon-load of necessaries to relieve their distress. Frya&rsquo;s
maidens came around him and wrote his deed in the eternal book, and
wiped out all his sins. This was reported to the Eeremoeder, and she
had it made known over the whole country.</p>

<p>What appears at the top is the signs of the Juul&mdash;that is, the
first symbol of Wr-alda, also of the origin or beginning from which
Time is derived; this is the Kroder, which must always go round with
the Juul. According to this model Frya formed the set hand which she
used to write her Tex. When Fasta was Eeremoeder she made a running
hand out of it. The Witkoning&mdash;that is, the Sea-King Godfried the
Old&mdash;made separate numbers for the set hand and for the runic
hand. It is therefore not too much that we celebrate it once a year. We
may be eternally thankful to Wr-alda that he allowed his spirit to
exercise such an influence over our forefathers.</p>
<p>In her time Finda also invented a mode of writing, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1189" href="#xd21e1189" name=
"xd21e1189">67</a>]</span>but that was so high-flown and full of
flourishes that her descendants have soon lost the meaning of it.</p>
<p>Afterwards they learned our writing&mdash;that is, the Finns, the
Thyriers, and the Krekalanders&mdash;but they did not know that it was
taken from the Juul, and most therefore always be written round like
the sun. Furthermore, they wished that their writing should be
illegible by other people, because they always had matters to conceal.
In doing this they acted very unwisely, because their children could
only with great difficulty read the writings of their predecessors,
whereas our most ancient writings are as easy to read as those that
were written yesterday.</p>
<p>Here is a specimen of the set hand and of the running hand, as well

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before the bad time came our country was the most
beautiful in the world. The sun rose higher, and there was seldom
frost. The trees and shrubs produced various fruits, which are now
lost. In the fields we had not only barley, oats, and rye, but wheat
which shone like gold, and which could be baked in the sun&rsquo;s
rays. The years were not counted, for one was as happy as another.</p>
<p>On one side we were bounded by Wr-alda&rsquo;s Sea, on which no one
but us might or could sail; on the other side we were hedged in by the
broad Twiskland (<span lang="nl">Tusschenland, Duitschland</span>),
through which the Finda people dared not come on account of the thick
forests and the wild beasts.</p>
<p>Eastward our boundary went to the extremity of the East Sea, and
westward to the Mediterranean <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1209"
href="#xd21e1209" name="xd21e1209">69</a>]</span>Sea; so that besides
the small rivers we had twelve large rivers given us by Wr-alda to keep
our land moist, and to show our seafaring men the way to his sea.</p>
<p>The banks of these rivers were at one time entirely inhabited by our
people, as well as the banks of the Rhine from one end to the other.
Opposite Denmark and Jutland we had colonies and a Burgtmaagd. Thence
we obtained copper and iron, as well as tar and pitch, and some other
necessaries. Opposite to us we had Britain, formerly Westland, with her
tin mines.</p>
<p>Britain was the land of the exiles, who with the help of their
Burgtmaagd had gone away to save their lives; but in order that they
might not come back they were tattooed with a B on the forehead, the
banished with a red dye, the other criminals with blue. Moreover, our
sailors and merchants had many factories among the distant Krekalanders
and in Lydia. In Lydia (Lybia) the people are black. As our country was
so great and extensive, we had many different names. Those who were
settled to the east of Denmark were called Jutten, because often they
did nothing else than look for amber (<i>jutten</i>) on the shore.
Those who lived in the islands were called Letten, because they lived
an isolated life. All those who lived between Denmark and the Sandval,
now the Scheldt, were called Stuurlieden (pilots), Zeekampers (naval
men), and Angelaren (fishermen). The Angelaren were men who fished in
the sea, and were so named because they used lines and hooks instead of
nets. From there to the nearest part of Krekaland the inhabitants were
called Kadhemers, because they never went to sea but remained
ashore.</p>
<p>Those who were settled in the higher marches bounded by Twisklanden
(Germany) were called Saxmannen, because they were always armed against
the wild beasts and the savage Britons. Besides <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1220" href="#xd21e1220" name=
"xd21e1220">71</a>]</span>these we had the names Landzaten (natives of
the land), Marzaten (natives of the fens), and Woud or Hout zaten
(natives of the woods).</p>

<p class="first">During the whole summer the sun had been hid behind
the clouds, as if unwilling to look upon the earth. There was perpetual
calm, and the damp mist hung like a wet sail over the houses and the
marshes. The air was heavy and oppressive, and in men&rsquo;s hearts
was neither joy nor cheerfulness. In the midst of this stillness the
earth began to tremble as if she was dying. The mountains opened to
vomit forth fire and flames. Some sank into the bosom of the earth, and
in other places mountains rose out of the plain. Aldland, called by the
seafaring people, Atland, disappeared, and the wild waves rose so high
over hill and dale that everything was buried in the sea. Many people
were swallowed up by the earth, and others who had escaped the fire
perished in the water.</p>
<p>It was not only in Finda&rsquo;s land that the earth vomited fire,
but also in Twiskland (Germany). Whole forests were burned one after
the other, and when the wind blew from that quarter our land was
covered with ashes. Rivers changed their course, and at their mouths
new islands were formed of sand and drift.</p>
<p>During three years this continued, but at length it ceased, and
forests became visible. Many countries were submerged, and in other
places land rose above the sea, and the wood was destroyed through the
half of Twiskland (Germany). Troops of Finda&rsquo;s people came and
settled in the empty places. Our dispersed people were exterminated or
made slaves. Then watchfulness was doubly impressed upon us, and time
taught us that union is force.</p>

<p>One hundred and one years after the submersion of Aldland a people
came out of the East. That people was driven by another. Behind us, in
Twiskland (Germany), they fell into disputes, divided into two parties,
and each went its own way. Of the one no account has come to us, but
the other came in the back of our Schoonland, which was thinly
inhabited, particularly the upper part. Therefore they were able to
take possession of it without contest, and as they did no other harm,
we would not make war about it. Now that we have learned to know them,
we will describe their customs, and after that how matters went between
us. They were not wild people, like most of Finda&rsquo;s race; but,
like the Egyptians, they have priests and also statues in their
churches. The priests are the only rulers; they call themselves
Magyars, and their headman Magy. He is high priest and king in one. The
rest of the people are of no account, and in subjection to them. This
people have not even a name; but we call them Finns, because although
all the festivals are melancholy and bloody, they are so formal that we
are inferior to them in that respect. But still they are not to be
envied, because they are slaves to their priests, and still more to
their creeds. They believe that evil spirits abound everywhere, and
enter into men and beasts, but of Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit they know
nothing. They have weapons of stone, the Magyars of copper. The Magyars
affirm that they can exorcise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1251"
href="#xd21e1251" name="xd21e1251">75</a>]</span>and recall the evil
spirits, and this frightens the people, so that you never see a
cheerful face. When they were well established, the Magyars sought our
friendship, they praised our language and customs, our cattle and iron
weapons, which they would willingly have exchanged for their gold and
silver ornaments, and they always kept their people within their own
boundaries, and that outwitted our watchfulness.</p>
<p>Eighty years afterwards, just at the time of the Juulfeest, they
overran our country like a snowstorm driven by the wind. All who could
not flee away were killed. Frya was appealed to, but the Schoonlanders
(Scandinavians) had neglected her advice. Then all the forces were
assembled, and three hours from Godasburgt they were withstood, but war
continued. Kat or Katerine was the name of the priestess who was
Burgtmaagd of Godasburgt. Kat was proud and haughty, and would neither
seek counsel nor aid from the mother; but when the Burgtheeren
(citizens) knew this, they themselves sent messengers to Texland to the
Eeremoeder. Minna&mdash;this was the name of the mother&mdash;summoned
all the sailors and the young men from Oostflyland and Denmark. From
this expedition the history of Wodin sprang, which is inscribed on the
citadels, and is here copied. At Aldergamude there lived an old
sea-king whose name was Sterik, and whose deeds were famous. This old
fellow had three nephews. Wodin, the eldest, lived at Lumkamakia, near
the Eemude, in Oostflyland, with his parents. He had once commanded
troops. Teunis and Inka were naval warriors, and were just then staying
with their father at Aldergamude. When the young warriors had assembled
together, they chose Wodin to be their leader or king, and the naval
force chose Teunis for their sea-king and Inka for their admiral. The
navy then sailed to Denmark, where they took on board Wodin and his
valiant host. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1255" href=
"#xd21e1255" name="xd21e1255">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>The wind was fair, so they arrived immediately in Schoonland. When
the northern brothers met together, Wodin divided his powerful army
into three bodies. Frya was their war-cry, and they drove back the
Finns and Magyars like children. When the Magy heard how his forces had
been utterly defeated, he sent messengers with truncheon and crown, who
said to Wodin: O almighty king, we are guilty, but all that we have
done was done from necessity. You think that we attacked your brothers
out of <span class="corr" id="xd21e1258" title="Source: illwill">ill
will</span>, but we were driven out by our enemies, who are still at
our heels. We have often asked your Burgtmaagd for help, but she took
no notice of us. The Magy says that if we kill half our numbers in
fighting with each other, then the wild shepherds will come and kill
all the rest. The Magy possesses great riches, but he has seen that
Frya is much more powerful than all our spirits together. He will lay
down his head in her lap. You are the most warlike king on the earth,
and your people are of iron. Become our king, and we will all be your
slaves. What glory it would be for you if you could drive back the
savages! Our trumpets would resound with your praises, and the fame of
your deeds would precede you everywhere. Wodin was strong, fierce, and
warlike, but he was not clear-sighted, therefore he was taken in their
toils, and crowned by the Magy.</p>
<p>Very many of the sailors and soldiers to whom this proceeding was
displeasing went away secretly, taking Kat with them. But Kat, who did
not wish to appear before either the mother or the general assembly,
jumped overboard. Then a storm arose and drove the ships upon the banks
of Denmark, with the total destruction of their crews. This strait was
afterwards called the Kattegat. When Wodin was crowned, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1263" href="#xd21e1263" name=
"xd21e1263">79</a>]</span>attacked the savages, who were all horsemen,
and fell upon Wodin&rsquo;s troops like a hailstorm; but like a
whirl-wind they were turned back, and did not dare to appear again.
When Wodin returned, Magy gave him his daughter to wife. Whereupon he
was incensed with herbs; but they were magic herbs, and by degrees he
became so audacious that he dared to disavow and ridicule the spirits
of Frya and Wr-alda, while he bent his free head before the false and
deceitful images. His reign lasted seven years, and then he
disappeared. The Magy said that he was taken up by their gods and still
reigned over us, but our people laughed at what they said. When Wodin
had disappeared some time, disputes arose. We wished to choose another
king, but the Magy would not permit it. He asserted that it was his
right given him by his idols. But besides this dispute there was one
between the Magyars and Finns, who would honour neither Frya nor Wodin;
but the Magy did just as he pleased, because his daughter had a son by
Wodin, and he would have it that this son was of high descent. While
all were disputing and quarrelling, he crowned the boy as king, and set
up himself as guardian and counsellor. Those who cared more for
themselves than for justice let him work his own way, but the good men
took their departure. Many Magyars fled back with their troops, and the
sea-people took ship, accompanied by a body of stalwart Finns as
rowers.</p>
<p>Next comes upon the stage the history of Neef Teunis and Neef
Inka.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Teunis wished to return home, he went first
towards Denmark; but he might not land there, for so the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1272" href="#xd21e1272" name=
"xd21e1272">81</a>]</span>mother had ordered, nor was he to land at
Flyland nor anywhere about there. In this way he would have lost all
his people by want and hardship, so he landed at night to steal and
sailed on by day. Thus coasting along, he at length arrived at the
colony of Kadik (Cadiz), so called because it was built with a stone
quay. Here they bought all kinds of stores, but Tuntia the Burgtmaagd
would not allow them to settle there. When they were ready they began
to disagree. Teunis wished to sail through the straits to the
Mediterranean Sea, and enter the service of the rich Egyptian king, as
he had done before, but Inka said he had had enough of all those
Finda&rsquo;s people. Inka thought that perchance some high-lying part
of Atland might remain as an island, where he and his people might live
in peace. As the two cousins could not agree, Teunis planted a red flag
on the shore, and Inka a blue flag. Every man could choose which he
pleased, and to their astonishment the greater part of the Finns and
Magyars followed Inka, who had objected to serve the kings of
Finda&rsquo;s people. When they had counted the people and divided the
ships accordingly, the fleet separated. We shall hear of Teunis
afterwards, but nothing more of Inka.</p>
<p>Neef Teunis coasted through the straits to the Mediterranean Sea.
When Atland was submerged there was much suffering also on the shores
of the Mediterranean, on which account many of Finda&rsquo;s people,
Krekalanders, and people from Lyda&rsquo;s land, came to us. On the
other hand, many of our people went to Lyda&rsquo;s land. The result of
all this was that the Krekalanders far and wide were lost to the
superintendence of the mother. Teunis had reckoned on this, and had
therefore wished to find there a good <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1276" href="#xd21e1276" name="xd21e1276">83</a>]</span>haven from
which he might go and serve under the rich princes; but as his fleet
and his people had such a shattered appearance, the inhabitants on the
coasts thought that they were pirates, and drove them away. At last
they arrived at the Ph&oelig;nician coast, one hundred and ninety-three
years after Atland was submerged. Near the coast they found an island
with two deep bays, so that there appeared to be three islands. In the
middle one they established themselves, and afterwards built a city
wall round the place. Then they wanted to give it a name, but disagreed
about it. Some wanted to call it Fryasburgt, others Neeftunia; but the
Magyars and Finns begged that it might be called Thyrhisburgt.</p>
<p>Thyr was the name of one of their idols, and it was upon his
feast-day that they had landed there; and in return they offered to
recognise Teunis as their perpetual king. Teunis let himself be
persuaded, and the others would not make any quarrel about it. When
they were well established, they sent some old seamen and Magyars on an
expedition as far as the town of Sidon; but at first the inhabitants of
the coast would have nothing to do with them, saying, You are only
foreign adventurers whom we do not respect. But when we sold them some
of our iron weapons, everything went well. They also wished to buy our
amber, and their inquiries about it were incessant. But Teunis, who was
far-seeing, pretended that he had no more iron weapons or amber. Then
merchants came and begged him to let them have twenty vessels, which
they would freight with the finest goods, and they would provide as
many people to row as he would require. Twelve ships were then laden
with wine, honey, tanned leather, and saddles and bridles mounted in
gold, such as had never been seen before.</p>
<p>Teunis sailed to the Flymeer with all this treasure, which so
enchanted the Grevetman of Westflyland that he induced <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1282" href="#xd21e1282" name=
"xd21e1282">85</a>]</span>Teunis to build a warehouse at the mouth of
the Flymeer. Afterwards this place was called Almanaland, and the
market where they traded at Wyringen was called Toelaatmarkt. The
mother advised that they should sell everything except iron weapons,
but no attention was paid to what she said. As the Thyriers had thus
free play, they came from far and near to take away our goods, to the
loss of our seafaring people. Therefore it was resolved in a general
assembly to allow only seven Thyrian ships and no more in a year.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">What the Consequence of This Was.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the northernmost part of the Mediterranean there
lies an island close to the coast. They now came and asked to buy that,
on which a general council was held.</p>
<p>The mother&rsquo;s advice was asked, and she wished to see them at
some distance, so she saw no harm in it; but as we afterwards saw what
a mistake we had made, we called the island Missellia (Marseilles).
Hereafter will be seen what reason we had. The Golen, as the missionary
priests of Sidon were called, had observed that the land there was
thinly peopled, and was far from the mother. In order to make a
favourable impression, they had themselves called in our language
<i>followers of the truth;</i> but they had better have been called
<i>abstainers from the truth,</i> or, in short,
&ldquo;Triuwenden,&rdquo; as our seafaring people afterwards called
them. When they were well established, their merchants exchanged their
beautiful copper weapons and all sorts of jewels for our iron weapons
and hides of wild beasts, which were abundant in our southern
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1297" href="#xd21e1297" name=
"xd21e1297">87</a>]</span>countries; but the Golen celebrated all sorts
of vile and monstrous festivals, which the inhabitants of the coast
promoted with their wanton women and sweet poisonous wine. If any of
our people had so conducted himself that his life was in danger, the
Golen afforded him a refuge, and sent him to Phonisia, that is,
Palmland. When he was settled there, they made him write to his family,
friends, and connections that the country was so good and the people so
happy that no one could form any idea of it. In Britain there were
plenty of men, but few women. When the Golen knew this, they carried
off girls everywhere and gave them to the Britons for nothing. So all
these girls served their purpose to steal children from Wr-alda in
order to give them to false gods.</p>

<h2 class="main">Now We Will Write about the War between the
Burgtmaagden Kalta and Min-erva,</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>And how we thereby lost all our southern lands and
Britain to the Golen.</i></p>
<p>Near the southern mouth of the Rhine and the Scheldt there are seven
islands, named after Frya&rsquo;s seven virgins of the week. In the
middle of one island is the city of Walhallagara (Middelburg), and on
the walls of this city the following history is inscribed. Above it are
the words &ldquo;Read, learn, and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five hundred and sixty-three years after the submersion of
Atland&mdash;that is, 1600 years before Christ&mdash;a wise town
priestess presided here, whose name was Min-erva&mdash;called by the
sailors Nyhellenia. This name was well chosen, for her counsels were
new and clear above all others.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Scheldt, at Flyburgt, Sijrhed presided.
This maiden was full of tricks. Her face was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1312" href="#xd21e1312" name=
"xd21e1312">89</a>]</span>beautiful, and her tongue was nimble; but the
advice that she gave was always conveyed in mysterious terms. Therefore
the mariners called her Kalta, and the landsmen thought it was a title.
In the last will of the dead mother, Rosamond was named first, Min-erva
second, and Sijrhed third in succession. Min-erva did not mind that,
but Sijrhed was very much offended. Like a foreign princess, she wished
to be honoured, feared, and worshipped; but Min-erva only desired to be
loved. At last all the sailors, even from Denmark and Flymeer, did
homage to her. This hurt Sijrhed, because she wanted to excel Min-erva.
In order to give an impression of her great watchfulness, she had a
cock put on her banner. So then Min-erva went and put a sheep-dog and
an owl on her banner. The dog, she said, guards his master and his
flock, and the owl watches that the mice shall not devastate the
fields; but the cock in his lewdness and his pride is only fit to
murder his nearest relations. When Kalta found that her scheme had
failed she was still more vexed, so she secretly sent for the Magyars
to teach her conjuring. When she had had enough of this she threw
herself into the hands of the Gauls; but all her malpractices did not
improve her position. When she saw that the sailors kept more and more
aloof from her, she tried to win them back by fear. At the full moon,
when the sea was stormy, she ran over the wild waves, calling to the
sailors that they would all be lost if they did not worship her. Then
she blinded their eyes, so that they mistook land for water and water
for land, and in this way many a good ship was totally lost. At the
first war-feast, when all her countrymen were armed, she brought casks
of beer, which she had drugged. When they were all drunk <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1314" href="#xd21e1314" name=
"xd21e1314">91</a>]</span>she mounted her war-horse, leaning her head
upon her spear. Sunrise could not be more beautiful. When she saw that
the eyes of all were fixed upon her, she opened her lips and
said:&mdash;</p>
<p>Sons and daughters of Frya, you know that in these last times we
have suffered much loss and misery because the sailors no longer come
to buy our paper, but you do not know what the reason of it is. I have
long kept silence about it, but can do so no longer. Listen, then, my
friends, that you may know on which side to show your teeth. On the
other side of the Scheldt, where from time to time there come ships
from all parts, they make now paper from pumpkin leaves, by which they
save flax and outdo us. Now, as the making of paper was always our
principal industry, the mother willed that people should learn it from
us; but Min-erva has bewitched all the people&mdash;yes, bewitched, my
friends&mdash;as well as all our cattle that died lately. I must come
out with it. If I were not Burgtmaagd, I should know what to do. I
should burn the witch in her nest.</p>
<p>As soon as she had uttered these words she sped away to her citadel;
but the drunken people were so excited that they did not stop to weigh
what they had heard. In mad haste they hurried over the Sandfal, and as
night came on they burst into the citadel. However, Kalta again missed
her aim; for Min-erva, her maidens, and her lamp were all saved by the
alertness of the seamen.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">We Now Come to the History of Jon.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Jon, J&ocirc;n, Jhon, Jan, are all the same name,
though the pronunciation varies, as the seamen like to shorten
everything to be able to make it easier to call. Jon&mdash;that is,
&ldquo;Given&rdquo;&mdash;was a sea-king, born at Alberga, who sailed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1325" href="#xd21e1325" name=
"xd21e1325">93</a>]</span>from the Flymeer with a fleet of 127 ships
fitted out for a long voyage, and laden with amber, tin, copper, cloth,
linen, felt, otter-skins, beaver and rabbit skins. He would also have
taken paper from here, but when he saw how Kalta had destroyed the
citadel he became so angry that he went off with all his people to
Flyburgt, and out of revenge set fire to it. His admiral and some of
his people saved the lamp and the maidens, but they could not catch
Sijrhed (or Kalta). She climbed up on the furthest battlement, and they
thought she must be killed in the flames; but what happened? While all
her people stood transfixed with horror, she appeared upon her steed
more beautiful than ever, calling to them, &ldquo;To Kalta!&rdquo; Then
the other Schelda people poured out towards her. When the seamen saw
that, they shouted, &ldquo;We are for Min-erva!&rdquo; from which arose
a war in which thousands were killed.</p>
<p>At this time Rosamond the mother, who had done all in her power by
gentle means to preserve peace, when she saw how bad it was, made short
work of it. Immediately she sent messengers throughout all the
districts to call a general levy, which brought together all the
defenders of the country. The landsmen who were fighting were all
caught, but Jon with his seamen took refuge on board his fleet, taking
with him the two lamps, as well as Min-erva and the maidens of both the
citadels. Helprik, the chief, summoned him to appear; but while all the
soldiers were on the other side of the Scheldt, Jon sailed back to the
Flymeer, and then straight to our islands. His fighting men and many of
our people took women and children on board, and when Jon saw that he
and his people would be punished for their misdeeds, he secretly took
his departure. He did well, for all our islanders, and the other
Scheldt people who had been fighting were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1329" href="#xd21e1329" name=
"xd21e1329">95</a>]</span>transported to Britain. This step was a
mistake, for now came the beginning of the end. Kalta, who, people
said, could go as easily on the water as on the land, went to the
mainland and on to Missellia (Marseilles). Then came the Gauls out of
the Mediterranean Sea with their ships to Cadiz, and along all our
coasts, and fell upon Britain; but they could not make any good footing
there, because the government was powerful and the exiles were still
Frisians. But now came Kalta and said: You were born free, and for
small offences have been sent away, not for your own improvement, but
to get tin by your labour. If you wish to be free again, and take my
advice, and live under my care, come away. I will provide you with
arms, and will watch over you. The news flew through the land like
lightning, and before the carrier&rsquo;s wheel had made one revolution
she was mistress of all the Thyriers in all our southern states as far
as the Seine. She built herself a citadel on the high land to the
north, and called it Kaltasburgh. It still exists under the name of
K&ecirc;renak. From this castle she ruled as a true mother, against
their will, not <i>for</i> her followers, but <i>over</i> them, who
were thenceforth called Kelts. The Gauls gradually obtained dominion
over the whole of Britain, partly because they no longer had any
citadel; secondly, because they had there no Burgtmaagden; and thirdly,
because they had no real lamps. From all these causes the people could
not learn anything. They were stupid and foolish, and having allowed
the Gauls to rob them of their arms, they were led about like a bull
with a ring in his nose. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1337" href=

<h2 class="main">Now We Shall Write how it Fared with Jon.</h2>
<h2 class="main">It is Inscribed at Texland.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ten years after Jon went away, there arrived three
ships in the Flymeer; the people cried Huzza! (What a blessing!) and
from their accounts the mother had this written.</p>
<p>When Jon reached the Mediterranean Sea, the reports of the Gauls had
preceded him, so that on the nearest Italian coast he was nowhere safe.
Therefore he went with his fleet straight over to Lybia. There the
black men wanted to catch them and eat them. At last they came to Tyre,
but Min-erva said, Keep clear, for here the air has been long poisoned
by the priests. The king was a descendant of Teunis, as we were
afterwards informed; but as the priests wished to have a king, who,
according to their ideas, was of long descent, they deified Teunis, to
the vexation of his followers. After they had passed Tyre, the Tyrians
seized one of the rearmost ships, and as the ship was too far behind
us, we could not take it back again; but Jon swore to be revenged for
it. When night came, Jon bent his course towards the distant
Krekalanden. At last they arrived at a country that looked very barren,
but they found a harbour there. Here, said Min-erva, we need not
perhaps have any fear of princes or priests, as they always look out
for rich fat lands. When they entered the harbour, there was not room
for all the ships, and yet most of the people were too cowardly to go
any further. Then Jon, who wished to get away, went with his spear and
banner, calling to the young people, to know who would volunteer to
share his adventures. Min-erva did the same thing, but she wished to
remain there. The greater part stopped with Min-erva, but the young
sailors went with Jon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1348" href=
"#xd21e1348" name="xd21e1348">99</a>]</span>Jon took the lamp of Kalta
and her maidens with him. Min-erva retained her lamp and her own
maidens.</p>
<p>Between the near and the distant coasts of Italy Jon found some
islands, which he thought desirable. Upon the largest he built a city
in the wood between the mountains. From the smaller islands he made
expeditions for vengeance on the Tyrians, and plundered their ships and
their lands. Therefore these islands were called <span lang=
"la">Insul&aelig; Piratarum</span>, as well as <span lang="la">Johannis
Insul&aelig;</span>.</p>
<p>When Min-erva had examined the country which is called by the
inhabitants Attica, she saw that the people were all goatherds, and
that they lived on meat, wild roots, herbs, and honey. They were
clothed in skins, and had their dwellings on the slopes
(<i>hellinga</i>) of the hills, wherefore they were called Hellingers.
At first they ran away, but when they found that we did not attack
them, they came back and showed great friendship. Min-erva asked if we
might settle there peaceably. This was agreed to on the condition that
we should help them to fight against their neighbours, who came
continually to carry away their children and to rob their dwellings.
Then we built a citadel at an hour&rsquo;s distance from the harbour.
By the advice of Min-erva it was called Athens, because, she said,
those who come after us ought to know that we are not here by cunning
or violence, but were received as friends (<i lang=
"fy-oer">&acirc;tha</i>). While we were building the citadel the
principal personages came to see us, and when they saw that we had no
slaves it did not please them, and they gave her to understand it, as
they thought that she was a princess. But Min-erva said, How did you
get your slaves? They answered, We bought some and took others in war.
Min-erva replied, If nobody would buy slaves they would <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1366" href="#xd21e1366" name=
"xd21e1366">101</a>]</span>not steal your children, and you would have
no wars about it. If you wish to remain our allies, you will free your
slaves. The chiefs did not like this, and wanted to drive us away; but
the most enlightened of the people came and helped us to build our
citadel, which was built of stone.</p>
<p>This is the history of Jon and of Min-erva.</p>
<p>When they had finished their story they asked respectfully for iron
weapons; for, said they, our foes are powerful, but if we have good
arms we can withstand them. When this had been agreed to, the people
asked if Frya&rsquo;s customs would flourish in Athens and in other
parts of Greece (Krekalanden). The mother answered, If the distant
Greeks belong to the direct descent of Frya, then they will flourish;
but if they do not descend from Frya, then there will be a long
contention about it, because the carrier must make five thousand
revolutions of his Juul before Finda&rsquo;s people will be ripe for
liberty.</p>

<h2 class="main">This is about the Geertmen.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Hellenia or Min-erva died, the priests pretended
to be with us, and in order to make it appear so, they deified
Hellenia. They refused to have any other mother chosen, saying that
they feared there was no one among her maidens whom they could trust as
they had trusted Min-erva, surnamed Nyhellenia.</p>
<p>But we would not recognise Min-erva as a goddess, because she
herself had told us that no one could be perfectly good except the
spirit of Wr-alda. Therefore we chose Geert Pyre&rsquo;s daughter for
our mother. When the priests saw that they could not fry their herrings
on our fire (have everything their own way), they left Athens, and said
that we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1379" href="#xd21e1379"
name="xd21e1379">103</a>]</span>refused to acknowledge Min-erva as a
goddess out of envy, because she had shown so much affection to the
natives. Thereupon they gave the people statues of her, declaring that
they might ask of them whatever they liked, as long as they were
obedient to her. By these kinds of tales the stupid people were
estranged from us, and at last they attacked us; but as we had built
our stone city wall with two horns down to the sea, they could not get
at us. Then, lo and behold! an Egyptian high priest, bright of eye,
clear of brain, and enlightened of mind, whose name was Cecrops, came
to give them advice.</p>
<p>When he saw that with his people he could not storm our wall, he
sent messengers to Tyre. Thereupon there arrived three hundred ships
full of wild mountain soldiers, which sailed unexpectedly into our
haven while we were defending the walls. When they had taken our
harbour, the wild soldiers wanted to plunder the village and our
ships&mdash;one had already ravished a girl&mdash;but Cecrops would not
permit it; and the Tyrian sailors, who still had Frisian blood in their
veins, said, If you do that we will burn our ships, and you shall never
see your mountains again. Cecrops, who had no inclination towards
murder or devastation, sent messengers to Geert, requiring her to give
up the citadel, offering her free exit with all her live and dead
property, and her followers the same. The wisest of the citizens,
seeing that they could not hold the citadel, advised Geert to accept at
once, before Cecrops became furious and changed his mind. Three months
afterwards Geert departed with the best of Frya&rsquo;s sons, and seven
times twelve ships. Soon after they had left the harbour they fell in
with at least thirty ships coming from Tyre with women and children.
They were on their way to Athens, but when they heard how things stood
there they went with Geert. The sea-king of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1383" href="#xd21e1383" name=
"xd21e1383">105</a>]</span>the Tyrians brought them altogether through
the strait which at that time ran into the Red Sea (now re-established
as the Suez Canal). At last they landed at the Punjab, called in our
language the Five Rivers, because five rivers flow together to the sea.
Here they settled, and called it Geertmania. The King of Tyre
afterwards, seeing that all his best sailors were gone, sent all his
ships with his wild soldiers to catch them, dead or alive. When they
arrived at the strait, both the sea and the earth trembled. The land
was upheaved so that all the water ran out of the strait, and the muddy
shores were raised up like a rampart. This happened on account of the
virtues of the Geertmen, as every one can plainly understand.</p>

Submerged, This was Inscribed on the Eastern Wall of Fryasburgt.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After twelve years had elapsed without our seeing any
Italians in Almanland, there came three ships, finer than any that we
possessed or had ever seen.</p>
<p>On the largest of them was a king of the Jonischen Islands whose
name was Ulysses, the fame of whose wisdom was great. To him a
priestess had prophesied that he should become the king of all Italy
provided he could obtain a lamp that had been lighted at the lamp in
Texland. For this purpose he had brought great treasures with him,
above all, jewels for women more beautiful than had ever been seen
before. They were from Troy, a town that the Greeks had taken. All
these treasures he offered to the mother, but the mother would have
nothing to do with them. At last, when he found that there was nothing
to be got from her, he went to Walhallagara (Walcheren). There there
was established a Burgtmaagd whose name was Kaat, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1392" href="#xd21e1392" name=
"xd21e1392">107</a>]</span>but who was commonly called Kalip, because
her lower lip stuck out like a mast-head. Here he tarried for years, to
the scandal of all that knew it. According to the report of the
maidens, he obtained a lamp from her; but it did him no good, because
when he got to sea his ship was lost, and he was taken up naked and
destitute by another ship. There was left behind by this king a writer
of pure Frya&rsquo;s blood, born in the new harbour of Athens, who
wrote for us what follows about Athens, from which may be seen how
truly the mother Hel-licht spoke when she said that the customs of Frya
could never take firm hold in Athens.</p>
<p>From the other Greeks you will have heard a great deal of bad about
Cecrops, because he was not in good repute; but I dare affirm that he
was an enlightened man; very renowned both among the inhabitants and
among us, for he was against oppression, unlike the other priests, and
was virtuous, and knew how to value the wisdom of distant nations.
Knowing that, he permitted us to live according to our own Asegaboek.
There was a story current that he was favourable to us because he was
the son of a Frisian girl and an Egyptian priest: the reason of this
was that he had blue eyes, and that many of our girls had been stolen
and sold to Egypt, but he never confirmed this. However it may have
been, certain it is that he showed us more friendship than all the
other priests together. When he died, his successors soon began to tear
up our charters, and gradually to enact so many unsuitable statutes
that at long last nothing remained of liberty but the shadow and the
name. Besides, they would not allow the laws to be written, so that the
knowledge of them was hidden from us. Formerly all the cases in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1396" href="#xd21e1396" name=
"xd21e1396">109</a>]</span>Athens were pleaded in our language, but
afterwards in both languages, and at last in the native language only.
At first the men of Athens only married women of our own race, but the
young men as they grew up with the girls of the country took them to
wife. The bastard children of this connection were the handsomest and
cleverest in the world; but they were likewise the wickedest, wavering
between the two parties, paying no regard to laws or customs except
where they suited their own interests. As long as a ray of Frya&rsquo;s
spirit existed, all the building materials were for common use, and no
one might build a house larger or better than his neighbours; but when
some degenerate townspeople got rich by sea-voyages and by the silver
that their slaves got in the silver countries, they went to live out on
the hills or in the valleys. There, behind high enclosures of trees or
walls, they built palaces with costly furniture, and in order to remain
in good odour with the nasty priests, they placed there likenesses of
false gods and unchaste statues. Sometimes the dirty priests and
princes wished for the boys rather than the girls, and often led them
astray from the paths of virtue by rich presents or by force. Because
riches were more valued by this lost and degenerate race than virtue or
honour, one sometimes saw boys dressed in splendid flowing robes, to
the disgrace of their parents and maidens, and to the shame of their
own sex. If our simple parents came to a general assembly at Athens and
made complaints, a cry was raised, Hear, hear! there is a sea-monster
going to speak. Such is Athens become, like a morass in a tropical
country full of leeches, toads, and poisonous snakes, in which no man
of decent habits can set his foot. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">How our Denmark was lost to us 1602 years after the
submersion of Atland. Through the mad wantonness of Wodin, Magy had
become master of the east part of Scandinavia. They dare not come over
the hills and over the sea. The mother would not prevent it. She said,
I see no danger in their weapons, but much in taking the Scandinavians
back again, because they are so degenerate and spoilt. The general
assembly were of the same opinion. Therefore it was left to him. A good
hundred years ago Denmark began to trade; they gave their iron weapons
in exchange for gold ornaments, as well as for copper and iron-ore. The
mother sent messengers to advise them to have nothing to do with this
trade. There was danger to their morals in it, and if they lost their
morals they would soon lose their liberty. But the Denmarkers paid no
attention to her. They did not believe that they could lose their
morals, therefore they would not listen to her. At last they were at a
loss themselves for weapons and necessaries, and this difficulty was
their punishment. Their bodies were brilliantly adorned, but their
cupboards and their sheds were empty. Just one hundred years after the
first ship with provisions sailed from the coast, poverty and want made
their appearance, hunger spread her wings all over the country,
dissension marched proudly about the streets and into the houses,
charity found no place, and unity departed. The child asked its mother
for food; she had no food to give, only jewels. The women applied to
their husbands, the husbands appealed to the counts; the counts had
nothing to give, or if they had, they hid it away. Now the jewels must
be sold, but while the sailors <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1405"
href="#xd21e1405" name="xd21e1405">113</a>]</span>were away for that
purpose, the frost came and laid a plank upon the sea and the strait
(the Sound). When the frost had made the bridge, vigilance ceased in
the land, and treachery took its place. Instead of watching on the
shores, they put their horses in their sledges and drove off to
Scandinavia. Then the Scandinavians, who hungered after the land of
their forefathers, came to Denmark. One bright night they all came.
Now, they said, we have a right to the land of our fathers; and while
they were fighting about it, the Finns came to the defenceless villages
and ran away with the children. As they had no good weapons, they lost
the battle, and with it their freedom, and Magy became master. All this
was the consequence of their not reading Frya&rsquo;s Tex, and
neglecting her counsels. There are some who think that they were
betrayed by the counts, and that the maidens had long suspected it; but
if any one attempted to speak about it, his mouth was shut by golden
chains.</p>
<p>We can express no opinion about it, we can only say to you, Do not
trust too much to the wisdom of your princes or of your maidens; but if
you wish to keep things straight, everybody must watch over his own
passions, as well as the general welfare.</p>
<p>Two years afterwards Magy himself came with a fleet of light boats
to steal the lamp from the mother of Texland. This wicked deed he
accomplished one stormy winter night, while the wind roared and the
hail rattled against the windows. The watchman on the tower hearing the
noise, lighted his torch. As soon as the light from the tower fell upon
the bastion, he saw that already armed men had got over the wall.</p>
<p>He immediately gave the alarm, but it was too late. Before the guard
was ready, there were two thousand people battering the gate. The
struggle did not last long. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1413"
href="#xd21e1413" name="xd21e1413">115</a>]</span>As the guard had not
kept a good watch, they were overwhelmed. While the fight was going on,
a rascally Finn stole into the chamber of the mother, and would have
done her violence. She resisted him, and threw him down against the
wall. When he got up, he ran his sword through her: If you will not
have me, you shall have my sword. A Danish soldier came behind him and
clave his head in two. There came from it a stream of black blood and a
wreath of blue flame.</p>
<p>The Magy had the mother nursed on his own ship. As soon as she was
well enough to speak clearly, the Magy told her that she must sail with
him, but that she should keep her lamp and her maidens, and should hold
a station higher than she had ever done before. Moreover, he said that
he should ask her, in presence of all his chief men, if he would become
the ruler of all the country and people of Frya; that she must declare
and affirm this, or he would let her die a painful death. Then, when he
had gathered all his chiefs around her bed, he asked, in a loud voice,
Frana, since you are a prophetess, shall I become ruler over all the
lands and people of Frya? Frana did as if she took no notice of him;
but at last she opened her lips, and said: My eyes are dim, but the
other light dawns upon my soul. Yes, I see it. Hear, Irtha, and rejoice
with me. At the time of the submersion of Atland, the first spoke of
the Juul stood at the top. After that it went down, and our freedom
with it. When two spokes, or two thousand years, shall have rolled
down, the sons shall arise who have been bred of the fornication of the
princes and priests with the people, and shall witness against their
fathers. They shall all fall by murder, but what they have proclaimed
shall endure, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1417" href=
"#xd21e1417" name="xd21e1417">117</a>]</span>and shall bear fruit in
the bosoms of able men, like good seed which is laid in thy lap. Yet a
thousand years shall the spoke descend, and sink deeper in darkness,
and in the blood shed over you by the wickedness of the princes and
priests. After that, the dawn shall begin to glow. When they perceive
this, the false princes and priests will strive and wrestle against
freedom; but freedom, love, and unity will take the people under their
protection, and rise out of the vile pool. The light which at first
only glimmered shall gradually become a flame. The blood of the bad
shall flow over your surface, but you must not absorb it. At last the
poisoned animals shall eat it, and die of it. All the stories that have
been written in praise of the princes and priests shall be committed to
the flames. Thenceforth your children shall live in peace. When she had
finished speaking she sank down.</p>
<p>The Magy, who had not understood her, shrieked out, I have asked you
if I should become master of all the lands and people of Frya, and now
you have been speaking to another. Frana raised herself up, stared at
him, and said, Before seven days have passed your soul shall haunt the
tombs with the night-birds, and your body shall be at the bottom of the
sea. Very good, said the Magy, swelling with rage; say that I am
coming. Then he said to his executioners, Throw this woman overboard.
This was the end of the last of the mothers. We do not ask for revenge.
Time will provide that; but a thousand thousand times we will call with
Frya, Watch! watch! watch!</p>

<h2 class="main">How it Fared Afterwards with the Magy.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After the murder of the mother, he brought the lamp
and the maidens into his own ship, together with all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1426" href="#xd21e1426" name=
"xd21e1426">119</a>]</span>the booty that he chose. Afterwards he went
up the Flymeer because he wished to take the maiden of Medeasblik or
Stavoren and install her as mother; but there they were on their guard.
The seafaring men of Stavoren and Alderga would gladly have gone to
Jon, but the great fleet was out on a distant voyage; so they proceeded
in their small fleet to Medeasblik, and kept themselves concealed in a
sheltered place behind trees. The Magy approached Medeasblik in broad
daylight; nevertheless, his men boldly stormed the citadel. But as they
landed from the boats, our people sallied forth from the creek, and
shot their arrows with balls of burning turpentine upon the fleet. They
were so well aimed that many of the ships were instantly on fire. Those
left to guard the ships shot at us, but they could not reach us. When
at last a burning ship drifted towards the ship of the Magy, he ordered
the man at the helm to sheer off, but this man was the Dane who had
cleft the head of the Finn. He said, You sent our Eeremoeder to the
bottom of the sea to say that you were coming. In the bustle of the
fight you might forget it; now I will take care that you keep your
word. The Magy tried to push him off, but the sailor, a real Frisian
and strong as an ox, clutched his head with both hands, and pitched him
into the surging billows. Then he hoisted up his brown shield, and
sailed straight to our fleet. Thus the maidens came unhurt to us; but
the lamp was extinguished, and no one knew how that had happened. When
those on the uninjured ships heard that the Magy was drowned, they
sailed away, because their crews were Danes. When the fleet was far
enough off, our sailors turned and shot their burning arrows at the
Finns. When the Finns saw that, and found that they were betrayed, they
fell into confusion, and lost all discipline and order. At this moment
the garrison sallied <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1428" href=
"#xd21e1428" name="xd21e1428">121</a>]</span>forth from the citadel.

<h2 class="main">The Writings of Adelbrost and Apollonia.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My name is Adelbrost, the son of Apol and Adela. I was
elected by my people as Grevetman over the Lindaoorden. Therefore I
will continue this book in the same way as my mother has spoken it.</p>
<p>After the Magy was killed and Fryasburgt was restored, a mother had
to be chosen. The mother had not named her successor, and her will was
nowhere to be found. Seven months later a general assembly was called
at Gr&ecirc;neg&acirc; (Groningen), because it was on the boundary of
Saxamarken. My mother was chosen, but she would not be the mother. She
had saved my father&rsquo;s life, in consequence of which they had
fallen in love with each other, and she wished to marry. Many people
wished my mother to alter her decision, but she said an Eeremoeder
ought to be as pure in her conscience as she appears outwardly, and to
have the same love for all her children. Now, as I love Apol better
than anything else in the world, I cannot be such a mother. Thus spoke
and reasoned Adela, but all the other maidens wished to be the mother.
Each state was in favour of its own maiden, and would not yield.
Therefore none was chosen, and the kingdom was without any restraint.
From what follows you will understand Liudgert, the king who had lately
died, had been chosen in the lifetime of the mother, and seemingly with
the love and confidence of all the states. It was his turn to live at
the great court of Dokhem, and in the lifetime of the mother great
honour was done to him there, as there were more messengers and knights
there than had ever been seen there before. But now he was lonely and
forsaken, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1446" href="#xd21e1446"
name="xd21e1446">125</a>]</span>because every one was afraid that he
would set himself above the law, and rule them like the slave kings.
Every headman imagined that he did enough if he looked after his own
state, and did not care for the others. With the Burgtmaagden it was
still worse. Each of them depended upon her own judgment, and whenever
a Grevetman did anything without her, she raised distrust between him
and his people. If any case happened which concerned several states,
and one maid had been consulted, the rest all exclaimed that she had
spoken only in the interest of her own state. By such proceedings they
brought disputes among the states, and so severed the bond of union
that the people of one state were jealous of those of the rest, or at
least considered them as strangers; the consequence of which was that
the Gauls or Truwenden (Druids) took possession of our lands as far as
the Scheldt, and the Magy as far as the Wesara. How this happened my
mother has explained, otherwise this book would not have been written,
although I have lost all hope that it would be of any use. I do not
write in the hope that I shall win back the land or preserve it: in my
opinion that is impossible. I write only for the future generations,
that they may all know in what way we were lost, and that each may
learn that every crime brings its punishment.</p>
<p>My name is Apollonia. Two-and-thirty days after my mother&rsquo;s
death my brother Adelbrost was found murdered on the wharf, his skull
fractured and his limbs torn asunder. My father, who lay ill, died of
fright. Then my younger brother, Apol, sailed from here to the west
side of Schoonland. There he built a citadel named Lindasburgt, in
order there to avenge our wrong. Wr-alda accorded him many years for
that. He had five sons, who all caused fear <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1450" href="#xd21e1450" name=
"xd21e1450">127</a>]</span>to Magy, and brought fame to my brother.
After the death of my mother and my brother, all the bravest of the
land joined together and made a covenant, called the Adelbond. In order
to preserve us from injury, they brought me and my youngest brother,
Adelhirt, to the burgt&mdash;me to the maidens, and him to the
warriors. When I was thirty years old I was chosen as Burgtmaagd, and
my brother at fifty was chosen Grevetman. From mother&rsquo;s side my
brother was the sixth, but from father&rsquo;s side the third. By
right, therefore, his descendants could not put &ldquo;overa
Linda&rdquo; after their names, but they all wished to do it in honour
of their mother. In addition to this, there was given to us also a copy
of &ldquo;The Book of Adela&rsquo;s Followers.&rdquo; That gave me the
most pleasure, because it came into the world by my mother&rsquo;s
wisdom. In the burgt I have found other writings also in praise of my
mother. All this I will write afterwards.</p>
<p>These are the writings left by Bruno, who was the writer of this
burgt. After the followers of Adela had made copies, each in his
kingdom, of what was inscribed upon the walls of the burgt, they
resolved to choose a mother. For this purpose a general assembly was
called at this farm. By the first advice of Adela, Teuntje was
recommended. That would have been arranged, only that my Burgtmaagd
asked to speak: she had always supposed that she would be chosen
mother, because she was at the burgt from which mothers had generally
been chosen. When she was allowed to speak, she opened her false lips
and said: You all seem to place great value on Adela&rsquo;s advice,
but that shall not shut my mouth. Who is Adela, and whence comes it
that you respect her so highly? She was what I am now, a Burgtmaagd of
this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1454" href="#xd21e1454" name=
"xd21e1454">129</a>]</span>place; is she, then, wiser and better than I
and all the others? or is she more conversant with our laws and
customs? If that had been the case, she would have become mother when
she was chosen; but instead of that, she preferred matrimony to a
single life, watching over herself and her people. She is certainly
very clear-sighted, but my eyes are far from being dim. I have observed
that she is very much attached to her husband, which is very
praiseworthy; but I see, likewise, that Teuntje is Apol&rsquo;s niece.
Further I say nothing.</p>
<p>The principal people understood very well which way the wind blew
with her; but among the people there arose disputes, and as most of the
people came from here, they would not give the honour to Teuntje. The
conferences were ended, knives were drawn, and no mother was chosen.
Shortly afterwards one of our messengers killed his comrade. As he had
been a man of good character hitherto, my Burgtmaagd had permission to
help him over the frontier; but instead of helping him over to
Twiskland (Germany), she fled with him herself to Wesara, and then to
the Magy. The Magy, who wished to please his sons of Frya, appointed
her mother of Godaburgt, in Schoonland; but she wished for more, and
she told him that if he could get Adela out of the way he might become
master of the whole of Frya&rsquo;s land. She said she hated Adela for
having prevented her from being chosen mother. If he would promise her
Texland, her messenger should serve as guide to his warriors. All this
was confessed by her messenger.</p>

<p class="first">Fifteen months after the last general assembly, at the
festival of the harvest month, everybody gave himself <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1463" href="#xd21e1463" name=
"xd21e1463">131</a>]</span>up to pleasure and merry-making, and no one
thought of anything but diversion; but Wr-alda wished to teach us that
watchfulness should never be relaxed. In the midst of the festivities
the fog came and enveloped every place in darkness. Cheerfulness melted
away, but watchfulness did not take its place. The coastguard deserted
their beacons, and no one was to be seen on any of the paths. When the
fog rose, the sun scarcely appeared among the clouds; but the people
all came out shouting with joy, and the young folks went about singing
to their bagpipes, filling the air with their melody. But while every
one was intoxicated with pleasure, treachery had landed with its horses
and riders. As usual, darkness had favoured the wicked, and they had
slipped in through the paths of Linda&rsquo;s wood. Before
Adela&rsquo;s door twelve girls led twelve lambs, and twelve boys led
twelve calves. A young Saxon bestrode a wild bull which he had caught
and tamed. They were decked with all kinds of flowers, and the
girls&rsquo; dresses were fringed with gold from the Rhine.</p>
<p>When Adela came out of her house, a shower of flowers fell on her
head; they all cheered loudly, and the fifes of the boys were heard
over everything. Poor Adela! poor people! how short will be your joy!
When the procession was out of sight, a troop of Magyar soldiers rushed
up to Adela&rsquo;s house. Her father and her husband were sitting on
the steps. The door was open, and within stood Adelbrost her son. When
he saw the danger of his parents, he took his bow from the wall and
shot the leader of the pirates, who staggered and fell on the grass.
The second and third met a similar fate. In the meantime his parents
had seized their weapons, and went slowly to Jon&rsquo;s house. They
would soon have been taken, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1467" href="#xd21e1467" name="xd21e1467">133</a>]</span>Adela
came. She had learned in the burgt to use all kinds of weapons. She was
seven feet high, and her sword was the same length. She waved it three
times over her head, and each time a knight bit the earth.
Reinforcements came, and the pirates were made prisoners; but too
late&mdash;an arrow had penetrated her bosom! The treacherous Magy had
poisoned it, and she died of it.</p>

<p class="first">Yes, departed friend, thousands are arrived, and more
are coming. They wish to hear the wisdom of Adela. Truly, she was a
princess, for she had always been the leader. O Sorrow, what good can
you do!</p>
<p>Her garments of linen and wool she spun and wove herself. How could
she add to her beauty? Not with pearls, for her teeth were more white;
not with gold, for her tresses were more brilliant; not with precious
stones, for her eyes, though soft as those of a lamb, were so lustrous
that you could scarcely look into them. But why do I talk of beauty?
Frya was certainly not more beautiful; yes, my friends, Frya, who
possessed seven perfections, of which each of her daughters inherited
one, or at most three. But even if she had been ugly, she would still
have been dear to us. Is she warlike? Listen, my friend. Adela was the
only daughter of our Grevetman. She stood seven feet high. Her wisdom
exceeded her stature, and her courage was equal to both together. Here
is an instance. There was once a turf-ground on fire. Three children
got upon yonder gravestone. There was a furious wind. The people were
all shouting, and the mother was helpless. Then came Adela. What are
you all standing still here for? she cried. Try to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1476" href="#xd21e1476" name=
"xd21e1476">135</a>]</span>help them, and Wr-alda will give you
strength. Then she ran to the Krylwood and got some elder branches, of
which she made a bridge. The others then came to assist her, and the
children were saved. The children bring flowers to the place every
year. There came once three Ph&oelig;nician sailors, who began to
ill-treat the children, when Adela, having heard their screams, beat
the scoundrels till they were insensible, and then, to prove to them
what miserable wretches they were, she tied them all three to a
spindle.</p>
<p>The foreign lords came to look after their people, and when they saw
how ridiculously they had been treated they were very angry, till they
were told what had happened. Upon that they bowed themselves before
Adela, and kissed the hem of her garment. But come, distant living
friend. The birds of the forest fled before the numerous visitors.
Come, friend, and you shall hear her wisdom. By the gravestone of which
mention has already been made her body is buried. Upon the stone the
following words are inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">Tread softly, for here lies Adela.</p>
</div>
<p>The old legend which is written on the outside wall of the city
tower is not written in &ldquo;The Book of Adela&rsquo;s
Followers.&rdquo; Why this has been neglected I do not know; but this
book is my own, so I will put it in out of regard to my relations.</p>

Learn and announce to the people Wr-alda is the ancient of ancients,
for he created all things. Wr-alda is all in all, for he is eternal and
everlasting. Wr-alda is omnipresent but invisible, and therefore is
called a spirit. All that we can see of him are the created beings who
come to life through him and go again, because from Wr-alda all things
proceed and return to him. Wr-alda is the beginning and the end.
Wr-alda is the only almighty being, because from him all other strength
comes, and returns to him. Therefore he alone is the creator, and
nothing exists without him. Wr-alda established eternal principles,
upon which the laws of creation were founded, and no good laws could
stand on any other foundation. But although everything is derived from
Wr-alda, the wickedness of men does not come from him. Wickedness comes
from heaviness, carelessness, and stupidity; therefore they may well be
injurious to men, but never to Wr-alda. Wr-alda is wisdom, and the laws
that he has made are the books from which we learn, nor is any wisdom
to be found or gathered but in them. Men may see a great deal, but
Wr-alda sees everything. Men can learn a great deal, but Wr-alda knows
everything. Men can discover much, but to Wr-alda everything is open.
Mankind are male and female, but Wr-alda created both. Mankind love and
hate, but Wr-alda alone is just. Therefore Wr-alda is good, and there
is no good without him. In the progress of time all creation alters and
changes, but goodness alone is unalterable; and since Wr-alda is good,
he cannot <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1493" href="#xd21e1493"
name="xd21e1493">139</a>]</span>change. As he endures, he alone exists;
everything else is show.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Second Part of the Oldest Doctrine.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among Finda&rsquo;s people there are false teachers,
who, by their over-inventiveness, have become so wicked that they make
themselves and their adherents believe that they are the best part of
Wr-alda, that their spirit is the best part of Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit,
and that Wr-alda can only think by the help of their brains.</p>
<p>That every creature is a part of Wr-alda&rsquo;s eternal being, that
they have stolen from us; but their false reasoning and ungovernable
pride have brought them on the road to ruin. If their spirit was
Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit, then Wr-alda would be very stupid, instead of
being sensible and wise; for their spirit labours to create beautiful
statues, which they afterwards worship. Finda&rsquo;s people are a
wicked people, for although they presumptuously pretend among
themselves that they are gods, they proclaim the unconsecrated false
gods, and declare everywhere that these idols created the world and all
that therein is&mdash;greedy idols, full of envy and anger, who desire
to be served and honoured by the people, and who exact bloody
sacrifices and rich offerings; but these presumptuous and false men,
who call themselves God&rsquo;s servants and priests, receive and
collect everything in the name of the idols that have no real
existence, for their own benefit.</p>
<p>They do all this with an easy conscience, as they think themselves
gods not answerable to any one. If there are some who discover their
tricks and expose them, they hand them over to the executioners to be
burnt for their calumnies, with solemn ceremonies in honour of the
false gods; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1504" href="#xd21e1504"
name="xd21e1504">141</a>]</span>but really in order to save themselves.
In order that our children may be protected against their idolatrous
doctrine, the duty of the maidens is to make them learn by heart the
following: Wr-alda existed before all things, and will endure after all
things. Wr-alda is also eternal and everlasting, therefore nothing
exists without him. From Wr-alda&rsquo;s life sprang time and all
living things, and his life takes away time and every other thing.
These things must be made clear and manifest in every way, so that they
can be made clear and comprehensible to all. When we have learned thus
much, then we say further: In what regards our existence, we are a part
of Wr-alda&rsquo;s everlasting being, like the existence of all created
beings; but as regards our form, our qualities, our spirit, and all our
thoughts, these do not belong to the being. All these are passing
things which appear through Wr-alda&rsquo;s life, and which appear
through his wisdom, and not otherwise; but whereas his life is
continually progressing, nothing can remain stationary, therefore all
created things change their locality, their form, and their thoughts.
So neither the earth nor any other created object can say, I am; but
rather, I was. So no man can say, I think; but rather, I thought. The
boy is greater and different from the child; he has different desires,
inclinations, and thoughts. The man and father feels and thinks
differently from the boy, the old man just the same. Everybody knows
that. Besides, everybody knows and must acknowledge that he is now
changing, that he changes every minute even while he says, I am, and
that his thoughts change even while he says, I think. Instead, then, of
imitating Finda&rsquo;s wicked people, and saying, I am the best part
of Wr-alda, and through us alone he can think, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1506" href="#xd21e1506" name=
"xd21e1506">143</a>]</span>we proclaim everywhere where it is
necessary, We, Frya&rsquo;s children, exist through Wr-alda&rsquo;s
life&mdash;in the beginning mean and base, but always advancing towards
perfection without ever attaining the excellence of Wr-alda himself.
Our spirit is not Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit, it is merely a shadow of it.
When Wr-alda created us, he lent us his wisdom, brains, organs, memory,
and many other good qualities. By this means we are able to contemplate
his creatures and his laws; by this means we can learn and can speak of
them always, and only for our own benefit. If Wr-alda had given us no
organs, we should have known nothing, and been more irrational than a
piece of sea-weed driven up and down by the ebb and flood.</p>

<h2 class="main">This is Written on
Parchment&mdash;&ldquo;Skrivfilt.&rdquo; Speech and Answer to other
Maidens as an Example.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">An unsociable, avaricious man came to complain to
Troost, who was the maid of Stavia. He said a thunderstorm had
destroyed his house. He had prayed to Wr-alda, but Wr-alda had given
him no help. Are you a true Frisian? Troost asked. From father and
forefathers, replied the man. Then she said, I will sow something in
your conscience, in confidence that it will take root, grow, and bear
fruit. She continued, When Frya was born, our mother stood naked and
bare, unprotected from the rays of the sun. She could ask no one, and
there was no one who could give her any help. Then Wr-alda wrought in
her conscience inclination and love, anxiety and fright. She looked
round her, and her inclination chose the best. She sought a
hiding-place under the sheltering lime-trees, but the rain came, and
the difficulty was that she got wet. She had seen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1513" href="#xd21e1513" name=
"xd21e1513">145</a>]</span>how the water ran down the pendent leaves;
so she made a roof of leaves fastened with sticks, but the wind blew
the rain under it. She observed that the stem would afford protection.
She then built a wall of sods, first on one side, and then all round.
The wind grew stronger and blew away the roof, but she made no
complaint of Wr-alda. She made a roof of rushes, and put stones upon
it. Having found how hard it is to toil alone, she showed her children
how and why she had done it. They acted and thought as she did. This is
the way in which we became possessed of houses and porches, a street,
and lime-trees to protect us from the rays of the sun. At last we have
built a citadel, and all the rest. If your house is not strong enough,
then you must try and make another. My house was strong enough, he
said, but the flood and the wind destroyed it. Where did your house
stand? Troost asked. On the bank of the Rhine, he answered. Did it not
stand on a knoll? Troost asked. No, said the man; my house stood alone
on the bank. I built it alone, but I could not alone make a hillock. I
knew it, Troost answered; the maidens told me. All your life you have
avoided your neighbours, fearing that you might have to give or do
something for them; but one cannot get on in the world in that way, for
Wr-alda, who is kind, turns away from the niggardly. F&acirc;sta has
advised us, and it is engraved in stone over all our doors. If you are
selfish, distrustful towards your neighbours, teach your neighbours,
help your neighbours, and they will return the same to you. If this
advice is not good enough for you, I can give you no better. The man
blushed for shame, and slunk away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">Now I will Write Myself, First about My Citadel, and
then about what I have been Able to See.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My city lies near the north end of the Liudgaarde. The
tower has six sides, and is ninety feet high, flat-roofed, with a small
house upon it out of which they look at the stars. On either side of
the tower is a house three hundred feet long, and twenty-one feet
broad, and twenty-one feet high, besides the roof, which is round. All
this is built of hard-baked bricks, and outside there is nothing else.
The citadel is surrounded by a dyke, with a moat thirty-six feet broad
and twenty-one feet deep. If one looks down from the tower, he sees the
form of the Juul. In the ground among the houses on the south side all
kinds of native and foreign herbs grow, of which the maidens must study
the qualities. Among the houses on the north side there are only
fields. The three houses on the north are full of corn and other
necessaries; the two houses on the south are for the maidens to live in
and keep school. The most southern house is the dwelling of the
Burgtmaagd. In the tower hangs the lamp. The walls of the tower are
decorated with precious stones. On the south wall the Tex is inscribed.
On the right side of this are the formul&aelig;, and on the other side
the laws; the other things are found upon the three other sides.
Against the dyke, near the house of the Burgtmaagd, stand the oven and
the mill, worked by four oxen. Outside the citadel wall is the place
where the Burgtheeren and the soldiers live. The fortification outside
is an hour long&mdash;not a seaman&rsquo;s hour, but an hour of the
sun, of which twenty-four go to a day. Inside it is a plain five feet
below the top. On it are three hundred crossbows covered with wood and
leather.</p>
<p>Besides the houses of the inhabitants, there are along <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1524" href="#xd21e1524" name=
"xd21e1524">149</a>]</span>the inside of the dyke thirty-six
refuge-houses for the people who live in the neighbourhood. The field
serves for a camp and for a meadow. On the south side of the outer
fortification is the Liudgaarde, enclosed by the great wood of
lime-trees. Its shape is three-cornered, with the widest part outside,
so that the sun may shine in it, for there are a great number of
foreign trees and flowers brought by the seafarers. All the other
citadels are the same shape as ours, only not so large; but the largest
of all is that of Texland. The tower of the Fryaburgt is so high that
it rends the sky, and all the rest is in proportion to the tower. In
our citadel this is the arrangement: Seven young maidens attend to the
lamp; each watch is three hours. In the rest of their time they do
housework, learn, and sleep. When they have watched for seven years,
they are free; then they may go among the people, to look after their
morals and to give advice. When they have been three years maidens,
they may sometimes accompany the older ones.</p>
<p>The writer must teach the girls to read, to write, and to reckon.
The elders, or &ldquo;Greva,&rdquo; must teach them justice and duty,
morals, botany, and medicine, history, traditions, and singing, besides
all that may be necessary for them to give advice. The Burgtmaagd must
teach them how to set to work when they go among the people. Before a
Burgtmaagd can take office, she must travel through the country a whole
year. Three grey-headed Burgtheeren and three old maidens must go with
her. This was the way that I did. My journey was along the
Rhine&mdash;on this side up, and on the other side down. The higher I
went, the poorer the people seemed to be. Everywhere about the Rhine
the people dug holes, and the sand that was got out was poured with
water over fleeces to get the gold, but the girls did not wear golden
crowns of it. Formerly they were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1528" href="#xd21e1528" name="xd21e1528">151</a>]</span>more
numerous, but since we lost Schoonland they have gone up to the
mountains. There they dig ore and make iron. Above the Rhine among the
mountains I have seen Marsaten. The Marsaten are people who live on the
lakes. Their houses are built upon piles, for protection from the wild
beasts and wicked people. There are wolves, bears, and horrible lions.
Then come the Swiss, the nearest to the frontiers of the distant
Italians, the followers of Kalta and the savage Twiskar, all greedy for
robbery and booty. The Marsaten gain their livelihood by fishing and
hunting. The skins are sewn together by the women, and prepared with
birch bark. The small skins are as soft as a woman&rsquo;s skin. The
Burgtmaagd at Fryasburgt (Freiburg) told us that they were good, simple
people; but if I had not heard her speak of them first, I should have
thought that they were not Frya&rsquo;s people, they looked so
impudent. Their wool and herbs are bought by the Rhine people, and
taken to foreign countries by the ship captains. Along the other side
of the Rhine it was just the same as at Lydasburcht (Leiden). There was
a great river or lake, and upon this lake also there were people living
upon piles. But they were not Frya&rsquo;s people; they were black and
brown men who had been employed as rowers to bring home the men who had
been making foreign voyages, and they had to stay there till the fleet
went back.</p>
<p>At last we came to Alderga. At the head of the south harbour lies
the Waraburgt, built of stone, in which all kinds of clothes, weapons,
shells, and horns are kept, which were brought by the sea-people from
distant lands. A quarter of an hour&rsquo;s distance from there is
Alderga, a great river surrounded by houses, sheds, and gardens, all
richly decorated. In the river lay a great fleet ready, with banners of
all sorts of colours. On Frya&rsquo;s day the shields were hung on
board likewise. Some shone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1532"
href="#xd21e1532" name="xd21e1532">153</a>]</span>like the sun. The
shields of the sea-king and the admiral were bordered with gold. From
the river a canal was dug going past the citadel Forana (Vroonen), with
a narrow outlet to the sea. This was the egress of the fleet; the Fly
was the ingress. On both sides of the river are fine houses built,
painted in bright colours. The gardens are all surrounded by green
hedges. I saw there women wearing felt tunics, as if it were writing
felt.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1534src" href="#xd21e1534" name=
"xd21e1534src">1</a> Just as at Staveren, the girls wore golden crowns
on their heads, and rings on their arms and ankles. To the south of
Forana lies Alkmarum. Alkmarum is a lake or river in which there is an
island. On this island the black and brown people must remain, the same
as at Lydasburgt. The Burgtmaagd of Forana told me that the burgtheeren
go every day to teach them what real freedom is, and how it behoves men
to live in order to obtain the blessing of Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit. If
there was any one who was willing to listen and could comprehend, he
was kept there till he was fully taught. That was done in order to
instruct the distant people, and to make friends everywhere. I had been
before in the Saxenmarken, at the Mannagardaforde castle (Munster).
There I saw more poverty than I could discover wealth here. She
answered: So whenever at the Saxenmarken a young man courts a young
girl, the girls ask: Can you keep your house free from the banished
Twisklanders? Have you ever killed any of them? How many cattle have
you already caught, and how many bear and wolfskins have you brought to
market? And from this it comes that the Saxons have left the
cultivation of the soil to the women, that not one in a hundred can
read or write; from this it comes, too, that no one has a motto on his
shield, but only a misshapen form of some animal that he has killed;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1539" href="#xd21e1539" name=
"xd21e1539">155</a>]</span>and lastly, from this comes also that they
are very warlike, but sometimes as stupid as the beasts that they
catch, and as poor as the Twisklanders with whom they go to war. The
earth and the sea were made for Frya&rsquo;s people. All our rivers run
into the sea. The Lydas people and the Findas people will exterminate
each other, and we must people the empty countries. In movement and
sailing is our prosperity. If you wish the highlanders to share our
riches and wisdom, I will give you a piece of advice. Let the girls,
when they are asked to marry, before they say yes, ask their lovers:
What parts of the world have you travelled in? What can you tell your
children about distant lands and distant people? If they do this, then
the young warriors will come to us; they will become wiser and richer,
and we shall have no occasion to deal with those nasty people. The
youngest of the maids who were with me came from the Saxenmarken. When
we came back she asked leave to go home. Afterwards she became
Burgtmaagd there, and that is the reason why in these days so many of
our sailors are Saxons.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Writings of Fr&ecirc;thorik and Wiljow.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My name is Fr&ecirc;thorik, surnamed oera Linda, which
means over the Linden. In Ljudwardia I was chosen as Asga. Ljudwardia
is a new village within the fortification of the Ljudgaarda, of which
the name has fallen into disrepute. In my time much has happened. I had
written a good deal about it, but afterwards much more was related to
me. I will write an account of both one and the other after this book,
to the honour of the good people and to the disgrace of the bad.</p>
<p>In my youth I heard complaints on all sides. The bad time was
coming; the bad time did come&mdash;Frya had forsaken us. She withheld
from us all her watch-maidens, because monstrous idolatrous images had
been found within our landmarks. I burnt with curiosity to see those
images. In our neighbourhood a little old woman tottered in and out of
the houses, always calling out about the bad times. I came to her; she
stroked my chin; then I became bold, and asked her if she would show me
the bad times and the images. She laughed good-naturedly, and took me
to the citadel. An old man asked me if I could read and write. No, I
said. Then you must first go and learn, he replied, otherwise it may
not be shown to you. I went daily to the writer and learnt. Eight years
afterwards I heard that our Burgtmaagd had been unchaste, and that some
of the burgtheeren had committed treason with the Magy, and many people
took their part. Everywhere disputes arose. There were children
rebelling against their parents; good <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1551" href="#xd21e1551" name="xd21e1551">159</a>]</span>people
were secretly murdered. The little old woman who had brought everything
to light was found dead in a ditch. My father, who was a judge, would
have her avenged. He was murdered in the night in his own house. Three
years after that the Magy was master without any resistance. The Saxmen
had remained religious and upright. All the good people fled to them.
My mother died of it. Now I did like the others. The Magy prided
himself upon his cunning, but Irtha made him know that she would not
tolerate any Magy or idol on the holy bosom that had borne Frya. As a
wild horse tosses his mane after he has thrown his rider, so Irtha
shook her forests and her mountains. Rivers flowed over the land; the
sea raged; mountains spouted fire to the clouds, and what they vomited
forth the clouds flung upon the earth. At the beginning of the
Arnemaand (harvest month) the earth bowed towards the north, and sank
down lower and lower. In the Welvenmaand (winter month) the low lands
of Fryasland were buried under the sea. The woods in which the images
were, were torn up and scattered by the wind. The following year the
frost came in the Hardemaand (<span lang="nl">Louwmaand</span>,
January), and laid Fryasland concealed under a sheet of ice. In
Sellemaand (<span lang="nl">Sprokkelmaand</span>, February) there were
storms of wind from the north, driving mountains of ice and stones.
When the spring-tides came the earth raised herself up, the ice melted;
with the ebb the forests with the images drifted out to sea. In the
Winne, or Minnemaand (<span lang="nl">Bloeimaand</span>, May), every
one who dared went home. I came with a maiden to the citadel
Liudgaarde. How sad it looked there. The forests of the Lindaoorden
were almost all gone. Where Liudgaarde used to be was sea. The waves
swept over the fortifications. Ice had destroyed the tower, and the
houses lay heaped over each other. On the slope of the dyke I found a
stone <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1562" href="#xd21e1562" name=
"xd21e1562">161</a>]</span>on which the writer had inscribed his name.
That was a sign to me. The same thing had happened to other citadels as
to ours. In the upper lands they had been destroyed by the earth, in
the lower lands by the water. Fryasburgt, at Texland, was the only one
found uninjured, but all the land to the north was sunk under the sea,
and has never been recovered. At the mouth of the Flymeer, as we were
told, thirty salt swamps were found, consisting of the forest and the
ground that had been swept away. At Westflyland there were fifty. The
canal which had run across the land from Alderga was filled up with
sand and destroyed. The seafaring people and other travellers who were
at home had saved themselves, their goods, and their relations upon
their ships. But the black people at Lydasburgt and Alkmarum had done
the same; and as they went south they saved many girls, and as no one
came to claim them, they took them for their wives. The people who came
back all lived within the lines of the citadel, as outside there was
nothing but mud and marsh. The old houses were all smashed together.
People bought cattle and sheep from the upper lands, and in the great
houses where formerly the maidens were established cloth and felt were
made for a livelihood. This happened 1888 years after the submersion of
Atland.</p>
<p>For 282 years we had not had an Eeremoeder, and now, when everything
seemed lost, they set about choosing one. The lot fell upon Gosa,
surnamed Makonta. She was Burgtmaagd at Fryasburgt, in Texland. She had
a clear head and strong sense, and was very good; and as her citadel
was the only one that had been spared, every one saw in that her call.
Ten years after that the seafarers came from Forana and Lydasburgt.
They wished to drive the black men, with their wives and children, out
of the country. They wished to obtain the opinion of the mother upon
the subject. She asked them: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1566"
href="#xd21e1566" name="xd21e1566">163</a>]</span>Can you send them all
back to their country? If so, then lose no time, or they will find no
relatives alive. No, they said. Gosa replied: They have eaten your
bread and salt; they have placed themselves entirely under your
protection. You must consult your own hearts. But I will give you one
piece of advice. Keep them till you are able to send them back, but
keep them outside your citadels. Watch over their morals, and educate
them as if they were Frya&rsquo;s sons. Their women are the strongest
here. Their blood will disappear like smoke, till at last nothing but
Frya&rsquo;s blood will remain in their descendants. So they remained
here. Now, I should wish that my descendants should observe in how far
Gosa spoke the truth. When our country began to recover, there came
troops of poor Saxon men and women to the neighbourhoods of Staveren
and Alderga, to search for gold and other treasures in the swampy
lands. But the sea-people would not permit it, so they went and settled
in the empty village of the West Flyland in order to preserve their
lives.</p>

there arrived a fleet at Flymeer. The people shouted
&ldquo;Ho-n-s&ecirc;en&rdquo; (What a blessing). They sailed to
Staveren, where they shouted again. Their flags were hoisted, and at
night they shot lighted arrows into the air. At daylight some of them
rowed into the harbour in a boat, shouting again,
&ldquo;Ho-n-s&ecirc;en.&rdquo; When they landed a young fellow jumped
upon the rampart. In his hand he held a shield on which bread and salt
were laid. After him came a grey-headed man, who said we come from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1573" href="#xd21e1573" name=
"xd21e1573">165</a>]</span>the distant Greek land to preserve our
customs. Now we wish you to be kind enough to give us as much land as
will enable us to live. He told a long story, which I will hereafter
relate more fully. The old man did not know what to do. They sent
messengers all round, also to me. I went, and said now that we have a
mother it behoves us to ask her advice. I went with them myself. The
mother, who already knew it all, said: Let them come, they will help us
to keep our lands, but do not let them remain in one place, that they
may not become too powerful over us. We did as she said, which was
quite to their liking. Fryso remained with his people at Staveren,
which they made again into a port as well as they could. Wichhirte went
with his people eastwards to the Emude. Some of the descendants of Jon
who imagined that they sprang from the Alderga people went there. A
small number, who fancied that their forefathers had come from the
seven islands, went there and set themselves down within the enclosure
of the citadel of Walhallagara. Liudgert, the admiral of Wichhirt, was
my comrade, and afterwards my friend. Out of his diary I have taken the
following history.</p>
<p>After we had been settled 12 times 100 and twice 12 years in the
Five Waters (Punjab), whilst our naval warriors were navigating all the
seas they could find, came Alexander the King, with a powerful army
descending the river towards our villages. No one could withstand him;
but we sea-people, who lived by the sea, put all our possessions on
board ships and took our departure. When Alexander heard that such a
large fleet had escaped him, he became furious, and swore that he would
burn all the villages if we did not come back. Wichhirte was ill in
bed. When Alexander heard that, he waited till he was better. After
that he came to him, speaking very kindly&mdash;but he deceived,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1577" href="#xd21e1577" name=
"xd21e1577">167</a>]</span>as he had done before. Wichhirte answered:
Oh greatest of kings, we sailors go everywhere; we have heard of your
great deeds, therefore we are full of respect for your arms, and still
more for your wisdom; but we who are free-born Fryas children, we may
not become your slaves; and even if I would, the others would sooner
die, for so it is commanded in our laws. Alexander said: I do not
desire to take your land or make slaves of your people, I only wish to
hire your services. That I will swear by both our Gods, so that no one
may be dissatisfied. When Alexander shared bread and salt with him,
Wichhirte had chosen the wisest part. He let his son fetch the ships.
When they were all come back Alexander hired them all. By means of them
he wished to transport his people to the holy Ganges, which he had not
been able to reach. Then he chose among all his people and soldiers
those who were accustomed to the sea. Wichhirte had fallen sick again,
therefore I went alone with Nearchus, sent by the king. The voyage came
to an end without any advantage, because the Joniers and the
Ph&oelig;nicians were always quarrelling, so that Nearchus himself
could not keep them in order. In the meantime, the king had not sat
still. He had let his soldiers cut down trees and make planks, with
which, with the help of our carpenters, he had built ships. Now he
would himself become a sea-king, and sail with his whole army up the
Ganges; but the soldiers who came from the mountainous countries were
afraid of the sea. When they heard that they must sail, they set fire
to the timber yards, and so our whole village was laid in ashes. At
first we thought that this had been done by Alexander&rsquo;s orders,
and we were all ready to cast ourselves into the sea: but Alexander was
furious, and wished his own people to kill the soldiers. However,
Nearchus, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1579" href="#xd21e1579"
name="xd21e1579">169</a>]</span>who was not only his chief officer, but
also his friend, advised him not to do so. So he pretended to believe
that it had happened by accident, and said no more about it. He wished
now to return, but before going he made an inquiry who really were the
guilty ones. As soon as he ascertained it, he had them all disarmed,
and made them build a new village. His own people he kept under arms to
overawe the others, and to build a citadel. We were to take the women
and children with us. When we arrived at the mouth of the Euphrates, we
might either choose a place to settle there or come back. Our pay would
be guaranteed to us the same in either case. Upon the new ships which
had been saved from the fire he embarked the Joniers and the Greeks. He
himself went with the rest of his people along the coast, through the
barren wilderness; that is, through the land that Irtha had heaved up
out of the sea when she had raised up the strait as soon as our
forefathers had passed into the Red Sea.</p>
<p>When we arrived at New Gertmania (New Gertmania is the port that we
had made in order to take in water), we met Alexander with his army.
Nearchus went ashore, and stayed three days. Then we proceeded further
on. When we came to the Euphrates, Nearchus went ashore with the
soldiers and a large body of people; but he soon returned, and said,
The King requests you, for his sake, to go a voyage up the Red Sea;
after that each shall receive as much gold as he can carry. When we
arrived there, he showed us where the strait had formerly been. There
he spent thirty-one days, always looking steadily towards the
desert.</p>
<p>At last there arrived a great troop of people, bringing with them
200 elephants, 1000 camels, a quantity of timber, ropes, and all kinds
of implements necessary to drag our fleet to the Mediterranean Sea.
This astounded us, and seemed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1585"
href="#xd21e1585" name="xd21e1585">171</a>]</span>most extraordinary;
but Nearchus told us that his king wished to show to the other kings
that he was more powerful than any kings of Tyre had ever been. We were
only to assist, and that surely could do us no harm. We were obliged to
yield, and Nearchus knew so well how to regulate everything, that
before three months had elapsed our ships lay in the Mediterranean Sea.
When Alexander ascertained how his project had succeeded, he became so
audacious that he wished to dig out the dried-up strait in defiance of
Irtha; but Wr-alda deserted his soul, so that he destroyed himself by
wine and rashness before he could begin it. After his death his kingdom
was divided among his princes. They were each to have preserved a share
for his sons, but that was not their intention. Each wished to keep his
own share, and to get more. Then war arose, and we could not return.
Nearchus wished us to settle on the coast of Ph&oelig;nicia, but that
no one would do. We said we would rather risk the attempt to return to
Fryasland. Then he brought us to the new port of Athens, where all the
true children of Frya had formerly gone. We went, soldiers with our
goods and weapons. Among the many princes Nearchus had a friend named
Antigonus. These two had only one object in view, as they told
us&mdash;to help the royal race, and to restore freedom to all the
Greek lands. Antigonus had, among many others, one son named Demetrius,
afterwards called the &ldquo;City Winner.&rdquo; He went once to the
town of Salamis, and after he had been some time fighting there, he had
an engagement with the fleet of Ptolemy. Ptolemy was the name of the
prince who reigned over Egypt. Demetrius won the battle, not by his own
soldiers, but because we helped him. We had done this out of friendship
for Nearchus, because we knew that he was of bastard birth by his white
skin, blue eyes, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1587" href=
"#xd21e1587" name="xd21e1587">173</a>]</span>fair hair. Afterwards,
Demetrius attacked Rhodes, and we transported thither his soldiers and
provisions. When we made our last voyage to Rhodes, the war was
finished. Demetrius had sailed to Athens. When we came into the
harbour, the whole village was in deep mourning. Friso, who was king
over the fleet, had a son and a daughter so remarkably fair, as if they
had just come out of Fryasland, and more beautiful than any one could
picture to himself. The fame of this went all over Greece, and came to
the ears of Demetrius. Demetrius was vile and immoral, and thought he
could do as he pleased. He carried off the daughter. The mother did not
dare await the return of her <i>joi</i> (the sailors wives call their
husbands <i>joi</i> or <i lang="nl">zoethart</i> (sweetheart). The men
call their wives <i lang="nl">troost</i> (comfort) and <i>fro</i> or
<i>frow,</i> that is, <i>vreuyde</i> (delight) and frolic; that is the
same as <i lang="nl">vreugde</i>.<span class="corr" id="xd21e1614"
title="Not in source">)</span></p>
<p>As she dared not wait for her husband&rsquo;s return, she went with
her son to Demetrius, and implored him to send back her daughter; but
when Demetrius saw the son he had him taken to his palace, and did to
him as he had done to his sister. He sent a bag of gold to the mother,
which she flung into the sea. When she came home she was out of her
mind, and ran about the streets calling out: Have you seen my children.
Woe is me! let me find a place to hide in, for my husband will kill me
because I have lost his children.</p>
<p>When Demetrius heard that Friso had come home, he sent messengers to
him to say that he had taken his children to raise them to high rank,
and to reward him for his services. But Friso was proud and passionate,
and sent a messenger with a letter to his children, in which he
recommended them to accept the will of Demetrius, as he wished to
promote their happiness; but the messenger had another letter with
poison, which he ordered them to take: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1621" href="#xd21e1621" name="xd21e1621">175</a>]</span>But, said
he, your bodies have been defiled against your will. That you are not
to blame for; but if your souls are not pure, you will never come into
Walhalla. Your spirits will haunt the earth in darkness. Like the bats
and owls, you will hide yourselves in the daytime in holes, and in the
night will come and shriek and cry about our graves, while Frya must
turn her head away from you. The children did as their father had
commanded. The messenger had their bodies thrown into the sea, and it
was reported that they had fled. Now Friso wished to go with all his
people to Frya&rsquo;s land, where he had been formerly, but most of
them would not go. So Friso set fire to the village and all the royal
storehouses; then no one could remain there, and all were glad to be
out of it. We left everything behind us except wives and children, but
we had an ample stock of provisions and warlike implements.</p>
<p>Friso was not yet satisfied. When we came to the old harbour, he
went off with his stout soldiers and threw fire into all the ships that
he could reach with his arrows. Six days later we saw the war-fleet of
Demetrius coming down upon us. Friso ordered us to keep back the small
ships in a broad line, and to put the large ships with the women and
children in front. Further, he ordered us to take the crossbows that
were in the fore part and fix them on the sterns of the ships, because,
said he, we must fight a retreating battle. No man must presume to
pursue a single enemy&mdash;that is my order. While we were busy about
this, all at once the wind came ahead, to the great alarm of the
cowards and the women, because we had no slaves except those who had
voluntarily followed us. Therefore we could not escape the enemy by
rowing. But Wr-alda knew well why he <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1625" href="#xd21e1625" name="xd21e1625">177</a>]</span>did this;
and Friso, who understood it, immediately had the fire-arrows placed on
the crossbows. At the same time he gave the order that no one should
shoot before he did, and that we should all aim at the centre ship. If
we succeeded in this, he said, the others would all go to its
assistance, and then everybody might shoot as he best was able. When we
were at a cable and a half distance from them the Ph&oelig;nicians
began to shoot, but Friso did not reply till the first arrow fell six
fathoms from his ship. Then he fired, and the rest followed. It was
like a shower of fire; and as our arrows went with the wind, they all
remained alight and reached the third line. Everybody shouted and
cheered, but the screams of our opponents were so loud that our hearts
shrank. When Friso thought that it was sufficient he called us off, and
we sped away; but after two days&rsquo; slow sailing another fleet of
thirty ships came in sight and gained upon us. Friso cleared for action
again, but the others sent forward a small rowing-boat with messengers,
who asked permission to sail with us, as they were Joniers. They had
been compelled by Demetrius to go to the old haven; there they had
heard of the battle, and girding on their stout swords, had followed
us. Friso, who had sailed a good deal with the Joniers, said Yes; but
Wichirte, our king, said No. The Joniers, said he, are worshippers of
heathen gods; I myself have heard them call upon them. That comes from
their intercourse with the real Greeks, Friso said. I have often done
it myself, and yet I am as pious a Fryas man as any of you. Friso was
the man to take us to Friesland, therefore the Joniers went with us. It
seems that this was pleasing to Wr-alda, for before three months were
past we coasted along Britain, and three days later we could shout
huzza. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1627" href="#xd21e1627" name=

<h2 class="main">This Writing has been Given to Me about Northland and
Schoonland (Scandinavia).</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When our land was submerged I was in Schoonland. It
was very bad there. There were great lakes which rose from the earth
like bubbles, then burst asunder, and from the rents flowed a stuff
like red-hot iron. The tops of high mountains fell and destroyed whole
forests and villages. I myself saw one mountain torn from another and
fall straight down. When I afterwards went to see the place there was a
lake there. When the earth was composed there came a duke of
Lindasburgt with his people, and one maiden who cried everywhere, Magy
is the cause of all the misery that we have suffered. They continued
their progress, and their hosts increased. The Magy fled, and his
corpse was found where he had killed himself. Then the Finns were
driven to one place where they might live. There were some of mixed
blood who were allowed to stay, but most of them went with the Finns.
The duke was chosen as king. The temples which had remained whole were
destroyed. Since that time the good Northmen come often to Texland for
the advice of the mother; still we cannot consider them real Frisians.
In Denmark it has certainly happened as with us. The sea-people, who
call themselves famous sea-warriors, went on board their ships, and
afterwards went back again.</p>
<p class="xd21e154"><span class="corr" id="xd21e1635" title=
"Source: Heil">Hail</span>!</p>
<p>Whenever the Carrier has completed a period, then posterity shall
understand that the faults and misdeeds that the Brokmannen have
brought with them belonged to their forefathers; therefore I will
watch, and will describe as much of their manners as I have seen. The
Geertmannen I can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1640" href=
"#xd21e1640" name="xd21e1640">181</a>]</span>readily pass by. I have
not had much to do with them, but as far as I have seen they have
mostly retained their language and customs. I cannot say that of the
others. Those who descend from the Greeks speak a bad language, and
have not much to boast of in their manners. Many have brown eyes and
hair. They are envious and impudent, and cowardly from superstition.
When they speak, they put the words first that ought to come last. For
old they <i>at</i>; for salt, <i>s&acirc;t</i>; and for man,
<i>ma</i>&mdash;too many to mention. They also use abbreviations of
names, which have no meaning. The Joniers speak better, but they drop
the H, and put it where it ought not to be. When they make a statue of
a dead person they believe that the spirit of the departed enters into
it; therefore they have hidden their statues of Frya, F&acirc;sta,
Medea, Thiania, Hellenia, and many others. When a child is born, all
the relatives come together and pray to Frya to send her servants to
bless the child. When they have prayed, they must neither move nor
speak. If the child begins to cry, and continues some time, it is a bad
sign, and they suspect that the mother has committed adultery. I have
seen very bad things come from that. If the child sleeps, that is a
good sign&mdash;Frya&rsquo;s servants are come. If it laughs in its
sleep, the servants have promised it happiness. Moreover, they believe
in bad spirits, witches, sorcerers, dwarfs, and elves, as if they
descended from the Finns. Herewith I will finish, and I think I have
written more than any of my forefathers. Frethorik.</p>
<p>Frethorik, my husband, lived to the age of 63. Since 108 years he is
the first of his race who died a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1653" href="#xd21e1653" name="xd21e1653">183</a>]</span>peaceable
death; all the others died by violence, because they all fought with
their own people, and with foreigners for right and duty.</p>
<p>My name is Wiljo. I am the maiden who came home with him from
Saxsenmarken. In the course of conversation it came out that we were
both of Adela&rsquo;s race&mdash;thus our affection commenced, and we
became man and wife. He left me with five children, two sons and three
daughters. Konreed was my eldest son, Hachgana my second. My eldest
daughter is called Adela, my second Frulik, and the youngest Nocht.
When I went to Saxsenmarken I preserved three books&mdash;the book of
songs, the book of narratives, and the Hellenia book.</p>
<p>I write this in order that people may not think they were by
Apollonia. I have had a good deal of annoyance about this, and
therefore now wish to have the honour of it. I also did more. When Gosa
Makonta died, whose goodness and clear-sightedness have become a
proverb, I went alone to Texland to copy the writings that she had
left; and when the last will of Frana was found, and the writings left
by Adela or Hellenia, I did that again. These are the writings of
Hellenia. I have put them first because they are the oldest.</p>
<p class="xd21e154">Hail to all true Frisians.</p>
<p>In the olden times, the Slavonic race knew nothing of liberty. They
were brought under the yoke like oxen. They were driven into the bowels
of the earth to dig metals, and had to build houses of stone as
dwelling-places for princes and priests. Of all that they did nothing
came to themselves, everything must serve to enrich and make more
powerful the priests and the princes, and to satisfy them. Under this
treatment they grew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1663" href=
"#xd21e1663" name="xd21e1663">185</a>]</span>gray and old before their
time, and died without any enjoyment; although the earth produces
abundantly for the good of all her children. But our runaways and
exiles came through Twiskland to their boundaries, and our sailors came
to their harbours. From them they heard of liberty, of justice, and
laws, without which men cannot exist. This was all absorbed by the
unhappy people like dew into an arid soil. When they fully understood
this, the most courageous among them began to clank their chains, which
grieved the princes. The princes are proud and warlike; there is
therefore some virtue in their hearts. They consulted together and
bestowed some of their superfluity; but the cowardly hypocritical
priests could not suffer this. Among their false gods they had invented
also wicked cruel monsters. Pestilence broke out in the country; and
they said that the gods were angry with the domineering of the wicked.
Then the boldest of the people were strangled in their chains. The
earth drank their blood, and that blood produced corn and fruits that
inspired with wisdom those who ate them.</p>
<p>Sixteen hundred years ago (she writes, 593 B.C.), Atland was
submerged; and at that time something happened which nobody had
reckoned upon. In the heart of Findasland, upon a mountain, lies a
plain called Kasamyr (Cashmere) that is &ldquo;extraordinary.&rdquo;
There was a child born whose mother was the daughter of a king, and
whose father was a high-priest. In order to hide the shame they were
obliged to renounce their own blood. Therefore it was taken out of the
town to poor people. As the boy grew up, nothing was concealed from
him, so he did all in his power to acquire wisdom. His intellect was so
great that he understood everything that he saw or heard. The people
regarded him with respect, and the priests were afraid of his
questions. When he was of full age he went to his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1667" href="#xd21e1667" name=
"xd21e1667">187</a>]</span>parents. They had to listen to some hard
language; and to get rid of him they gave him a quantity of jewels, but
they dared not openly acknowledge him. Overcome with sorrow at the
false shame of his parents, he wandered about. While travelling he fell
in with a Frisian sailor who was serving as a slave, and who taught him
our manners and customs. He bought the freedom of the slave, and they
remained friends till death. Wherever he went he taught the people not
to tolerate rich men or priests, and that they must guard themselves
against false shame, which everywhere did harm to love and charity. The
earth, he said, bestowed her treasures on those who scratch her skin;
so all are obliged to dig, and plough, and sow if they wish to reap,
but no one is obliged to do anything for another unless it be out of
goodwill. He taught that men should not seek in her bowels for gold, or
silver, or precious stones, which occasion envy and destroy love. To
embellish your wives and daughters, he said, the river offers her pure
stream. No man is able to make everybody equally rich and happy, but it
is the duty of all men to make each other as equally rich and as happy
as possible. Men should not despise any knowledge; but justice is the
greatest knowledge that time can teach, because she wards off offences
and promotes love.</p>
<p>His first name was Jessos, but the priests, who hated him, called
him Fo, that is, false; the people called him Krishna, that is,
shepherd; and his Frisian friend called him Buddha (purse), because he
had in his head a treasure of wisdom, and in his heart a treasure of
love.</p>
<p>At last he was obliged to flee from the wrath of the priests; but
wherever he went his teaching had preceded him, whilst his enemies
followed him like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1674" href=
"#xd21e1674" name="xd21e1674">189</a>]</span>his shadow. When Jessos
had thus travelled for twelve years he died; but his friends preserved
his teaching, and spread it wherever they found listeners.</p>
<p>What do you think the priests did then? That I must tell you, and
you must give your best attention to it. Moreover, you must keep guard
against their acts and their tricks with all the strength that Wr-alda
has given you. While the doctrine of Jessos was thus spreading over the
earth, the false priests went to the land of his birth to make his
death known. They said they were his friends, and they pretended to
show great sorrow by tearing their clothes and shaving their heads.
They went to live in caves in the mountains, but in them they had hid
all their treasures, and they made in them images of Jessos. They gave
these statues to simple people, and at last they said that Jessos was a
god, that he had declared this himself to them, and that all those who
followed his doctrine should enter his kingdom hereafter, where all was
joy and happiness. Because they knew that he was opposed to the rich,
they announced everywhere that poverty, suffering, and humility were
the door by which to enter into his kingdom, and that those who had
suffered the most on earth should enjoy the greatest happiness there.
Although they knew that Jessos had taught that men should regulate and
control their passions, they taught that men should stifle their
passions, and that the perfection of humanity consisted in being as
unfeeling as the cold stones. In order to make the people believe that
they did as they preached, they pretended to outward poverty; and that
they had overcome all sensual feelings, they took no wives. But if any
young girl had made a false step, it was quickly forgiven; the weak,
they said, were to be assisted, and to save <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1678" href="#xd21e1678" name=
"xd21e1678">191</a>]</span>their souls men must give largely to the
Church. Acting in this way, they had wives and children without
households, and were rich without working; but the people grew poorer
and more miserable than they had ever been before. This doctrine, which
requires the priests to possess no further knowledge than to speak
deceitfully, and to pretend to be pious while acting unjustly, spreads
from east to west, and will come to our land also.</p>
<p>But when the priests fancy that they have entirely extinguished the
light of Frya and Jessos, then shall all classes of men rise up who
have quietly preserved the truth among themselves, and have hidden it
from the priests. They shall be of princely blood of priests, Slavonic,
and Frya&rsquo;s blood. They will make their light visible, so that all
men shall see the truth; they shall cry woe to the acts of the princes
and the priests. The princes who love the truth and justice shall
separate themselves from the priests; blood shall flow, but from it the
people will gather new strength. Finda&rsquo;s folk shall contribute
their industry to the common good, Linda&rsquo;s folk their strength,
and we our wisdom. Then the false priests shall be swept away from the
earth. Wr-alda&rsquo;s spirit shall be invoked everywhere and always;
the laws that Wr-alda in the beginning instilled into our consciences
shall alone be listened to. There shall be neither princes, nor
masters, nor rulers, except those chosen by the general voice. Then
Frya shall rejoice, and the earth will only bestow her gifts on those
who work. All this shall begin 4000 years after the submersion of
Atland, and 1000 years later there shall exist no longer either priest
or oppression.</p>
<p>Dela, surnamed Hellenia, watch! <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1684" href="#xd21e1684" name="xd21e1684">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus runs Frana&rsquo;s last will: All noble Frisians, Heil! In the
name of Wr-alda, of Frya, and of Freedom, I greet you; and pray you if
I die before I have named a successor, then I recommend to you Teuntja,
who is Burgtmaagd in the citadel of Medeasblik; till now she is the
best.</p>
<p>This Gosa has left behind her: Hail to all men! I have named no
Eeremoeder, because I know none, and because it is better for you to
have no mother than to have one you cannot trust. One bad time is
passed by, but there is still another coming. Irtha has not given it
birth, and Wr-alda has not decreed it. It comes from the East, out of
the bosom of the priests. It will breed so much mischief that Irtha
will not be able to drink the blood of her slain children. It will
spread darkness over the minds of men like storm-clouds over the
sunlight. Everywhere craft and deception shall contend with freedom and
justice. Freedom and justice shall be overcome, and we with them. But
this success will work out its own loss. Our descendants shall teach
their people and their slaves the meaning of three words; they are
universal love, freedom, and justice. At first they shall shine, then
struggle with darkness, until every man&rsquo;s head and heart has
become bright and clear. Then shall oppression be driven from the
earth, like the thunder-clouds by the storm-wind, and all deceit will
cease to have any more power. Gosa. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My forefathers have written this book in succession. I
will do this, the more because there exists no longer in my state any
citadel on which events are inscribed as used to be the case. My name
is Koner&ecirc;d (Koenraad). My father&rsquo;s name was Frethorik, my
mother&rsquo;s name was Wiljow. After my father&rsquo;s death I was
chosen as his successor. When I was fifty years old I was chosen for
chief Grevetman. My father has written how the Lindaoorden and
Liudgaarden were destroyed. Lindahem is still lost, the Lindaoorden
partially, and the north Lindgaarden are still concealed by the salt
sea. The foaming sea washes the ramparts of the castle. As my father
has mentioned, the people, being deprived of their harbour, went away
and built houses inside the ramparts of the citadel; therefore that
bastion is called Lindwerd. The sea-people say Linwerd, but that is
nonsense. In my youth there was a portion of land lying outside the
rampart all mud and marsh; but Frya&rsquo;s people were neither tired
nor exhausted when they had a good object in view. By digging ditches,
and making dams of the earth that came out of the ditches, we recovered
a good space of land outside the rampart, which had the form of a hoof
three poles eastward, three southwards, and three westwards. At present
we are engaged in ramming piles into the ground to make a harbour to
protect our rampart. When the work is finished we shall attract
mariners. In my youth it looked very queer, but now there stands a row
of houses. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1697" href="#xd21e1697"

poverty have been remedied by industry. From this men may learn that
Wr-alda, our universal father, protects all his creatures, if they
preserve their courage and help each other.</p>

<h2 class="main">Now I Will Write about Friso.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Friso, who was already powerful by his troops, was
chosen chief Grevetman of the districts round Staveren. He laughed at
our mode of defending our land and our sea-fights; therefore he
established a school where the boys might learn to fight in the Greek
manner, but I believe that he did it to attach the young people to
himself. I sent my brother there ten years ago, because I thought, now
that we have not got any mother, it behoves me to be doubly watchful,
in order that he may not become our master.</p>
<p>Gosa has given us no successors. I will not give any opinion about
that; but there are still old suspicious people who think that she and
Friso had an understanding about it. When Gosa died, the people from
all parts wished to choose another mother; but Friso, who was busy
establishing a kingdom for himself, did not desire to have any advice
or messenger from Texland. When the messengers of the Landsaten came to
him, he said that Gosa had been far-seeing and wiser than all the
counts together, and yet she had been unable to see any light or way
out of this affair; therefore she had not had the courage to choose a
successor, and to choose a doubtful one she thought would be very bad;
therefore she wrote in her last will, It is better to have no mother
than to have one on whom you cannot rely. Friso had seen a great deal.
He had been brought up in the wars, and he had just learned and
gathered as much of the tricks and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1706" href="#xd21e1706" name="xd21e1706">199</a>]</span>cunning
ways of the Gauls and the princes as he required, to lead the other
counts wherever he wished. See here how he went to work about that.</p>
<p>Friso had taken here another wife, a daughter of Wilfr&ecirc;the,
who in his lifetime had been chief count of Staveren. By her he had two
sons and two daughters. By his wish Kornelia, his youngest daughter,
was married to my brother. Kornelia is not good Frisian; her name ought
to be written Korn-helia. Weemoed, his eldest daughter, he married to
Kauch. Kauch, who went to school to him, is the son of Wichhirte, the
king of the Geertmen. But Kauch is likewise not good Frisian, and ought
to be Kaap (Koop). So they have learned more bad language than good
manners.</p>
<p>Now I must return to my story.</p>
<p>After the great flood of which my father wrote an account, there
came many Jutlanders and Letlanders out of the Baltic, or bad sea. They
were driven down the Kattegat in their boats by the ice as far as the
coast of Denmark, and there they remained. There was not a creature to
be seen; so they took possession of the land, and named it after
themselves, Jutland. Afterwards many of the Denmarkers returned from
the higher lands, but they settled more to the south; and when the
mariners returned who had not been lost, they all went together to
Zeeland. By this arrangement the Jutlanders retained the land to which
Wr-alda had conducted them. The Zeeland skippers, who were not
satisfied to live upon fish, and who hated the Gauls, took to robbing
the Ph&oelig;nician ships. In the south-west point of Scandinavia there
lies Lindasburgt, called Lindasn&ocirc;se, built by one Apol, as is
written in the book. All the people <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1714" href="#xd21e1714" name="xd21e1714">201</a>]</span>who live
on the coasts, and in the neighbouring districts, had remained true
Frisians; but by their desire for vengeance upon the Gauls, and the
followers of Kaltona, they joined the Zeelanders. But that connection
did not hold together, because the Zeelanders had adopted many evil
manners and customs of the wicked Magyars, in opposition to
Frya&rsquo;s people. Afterwards, everybody went stealing on his own
account; but when it suited them they held all together. At last the
Zeelanders began to be in want of good ships. Their shipbuilders had
died, and their forests as well as their land had been washed out to
sea. Now there arrived unexpectedly three ships, which anchored off the
ringdyk of our citadel. By the disruption of our land they had lost
themselves, and had missed Flymond. The merchant who was with them
wished to buy new ships from us, and for that purpose had brought all
kinds of valuables, which they had stolen from the Celtic country and
Ph&oelig;nician ships. As we had no ships, I gave them active horses
and four armed couriers to Friso; because at Stavere, along the
Alberga, the best ships of war were built of hard oak which never rots.
While these sea rovers remained with us, some of the Jutmen had gone to
Texland, and thence to Friso. The Zeelanders had stolen many of their
strongest boys to row their ships, and many of their finest daughters
to have children by. The great Jutlanders could not prevent it, as they
were not properly armed. When they had related all their misfortunes,
and a good deal of conversation had taken place, Friso asked them at
last if they had no good harbours in their country. Oh, yes, they
answered; a beautiful one, created by Wr-alda. It is like a bottle, the
neck narrow, but in the belly a thousand large boats may lie; but we
have no citadel and no defences to keep out <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1716" href="#xd21e1716" name=
"xd21e1716">203</a>]</span>the pirate ships. Then you should make them,
said Friso. That is very good advice, said the Jutlanders; but we have
no workmen and no building materials; we are all fishermen and
trawlers. The others are drowned or fled to the higher lands. While
they were talking in this way, my messengers arrived at the court with
the Zeeland gentlemen. Here you must observe how Friso understood
deceiving everybody, to the satisfaction of both parties, and to the
accomplishment of his own ends. To the Zeelanders he promised that they
should have yearly fifty ships of a fixed size for a fixed price,
fitted with iron chains and crossbows, and full rigging as is necessary
and useful for men-of-war, but that they should leave in peace the
Jutlanders and all the people of Frya&rsquo;s race. But he wished to do
more; he wanted to engage all our sea rovers to go with him upon his
fighting expedition. When the Zeelanders had gone, he loaded forty old
ships with weapons for wall defences, wood, bricks, carpenters, masons,
and smiths, in order to build citadels. Witto, or Witte, his son, he
sent to superintend. I have never been well informed of what happened;
but this much is clear to me, that on each side of the harbour a strong
citadel has been built, and garrisoned by people brought by Friso out
of Saksenmarken. Witto courted Siuchthirte and married her. Wilhem, her
father, was chief Alderman of the Jutmen&mdash;that is, chief Grevetman
or Count. Wilhem died shortly afterwards, and Witto was chosen in his
place.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">What Friso did Further.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of his first wife he still had two brothers-in-law,
who were very daring. Hetto&mdash;that is, heat&mdash;the youngest, he
sent as messenger to Kattaburgt, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1723" href="#xd21e1723" name="xd21e1723">205</a>]</span>lies far
in the Saxsenmarken. Friso gave him to take seven horses, besides his
own, laden with precious things stolen by the sea-rovers. With each
horse there were two young sea-rovers and two young horsemen, clad in
rich garments, and with money in their purses. In the same way as he
sent Hetto to Kattaburgt, he sent Bruno&mdash;that is, brown&mdash;the
other brother-in-law, to Mannagarda oord, Mannagarda oord was written
Mannagarda ford in the earlier part of this book, but that is wrong.
All the riches that they took with them were given away, according to
circumstances, to princes, princesses, and chosen young girls. When his
young men went to the tavern to dance with the young people there, they
ordered baskets of spice, gingerbread, and tuns of the best beer. After
these messengers he let his young people constantly go over to the
Saxsenmarken, always with money in their purses and presents to give
away, and they spent money carelessly in the taverns. When the Saxsen
youths looked with envy at this they smiled, and said, If you dare go
and fight the common enemy you would be able to give much richer
presents to your brides, and live much more princely. Both the
brothers-in-law of Friso had married daughters of the chief princes,
and afterwards the Saxsen youths and girls came in whole troops to the
Flymeer.</p>
<p>The burgtmaidens and old maidens who still remembered their
greatness did not hold with Friso&rsquo;s object, and therefore they
said no good of him; but Friso, more cunning than they, let them
chatter, but the younger maidens he led to his side with golden
fingers. They said everywhere, For a long time we have had no mother,
but that comes from our being fit to take care of ourselves. At present
it suits us best to have a king to win back our lands that we have lost
through the imprudence of our mothers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1727" href="#xd21e1727" name="xd21e1727">207</a>]</span>Further
they said, Every child of Frya has permission to let his voice be heard
before the choice of a prince is decided; but if it comes to that, that
you choose a king, then also we will have our say. From all that we can
see, Wr-alda has appointed Friso for it, for he has brought him here in
a wonderful way. Friso knows the tricks of the Gauls, whose language he
speaks; he can therefore watch against their craftiness. Then there is
something else to keep the eye upon. What count could be chosen as king
without the others being jealous of him? All such nonsense the young
maidens talked; but the old maidens, though few in number, tapped their
advice out of another cask. They said always and to every one: Friso
does like the spiders. At night he spreads his webs in all directions,
and in the day he catches in them all his unsuspecting friends. Friso
says he cannot suffer any priests or foreign princes, but we say that
he cannot suffer anybody but himself; therefore he will not allow the
citadel of Stavia to be rebuilt; therefore he will not have the mother
again. To-day Friso is your counsellor, to-morrow he will be your king,
in order to have full power over you. Among the people there now
existed two parties. The old and the poor wished to have the mother
again, but the young and the warlike wished for a father and a king.
The first called themselves mother&rsquo;s sons, the others
father&rsquo;s sons, but the mother&rsquo;s sons did not count for
much; because there were many ships to build, there was a good time for
all kinds of workmen. Moreover, the sea-rovers brought all sorts of
treasures, with which the maidens were pleased, the girls were pleased,
and their relations and friends. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1729" href="#xd21e1729" name="xd21e1729">209</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Friso had been nearly forty years at Staveren he died. Owing to
him many of the states had been joined together again, but that we were
the better for it I am not prepared to certify. Of all the counts that
preceded him there was none so renowned as Friso; for, as I said
before, the young maidens spoke in his praise, while the old maidens
did all in their power to make him hateful to everybody. Although the
old women could not prevent his meddling, they made so much fuss that
he died without becoming king.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Now I will Write about His Son Adel.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Friso, who had learned our history from the book of
the Adelingen, had done everything in his power to win their
friendship. His eldest son, whom he had by his wife Swethirte, he named
Adel; and although he strove with all his might to prevent the building
or restoring any citadels, he sent Adel to the citadel of Texland in
order to make himself better acquainted with our laws, language, and
customs. When Adel was twenty years old Friso brought him into his own
school, and when he had fully educated him he sent him to travel
through all the states. Adel was an amiable young man, and in his
travels he made many friends, so the people called him
Atharik&mdash;that is, rich in friends&mdash;which was very useful to
him afterwards, for when his father died he took his place without a
question of any other count being chosen.</p>
<p>While Adel was studying at Texland there was a lovely maiden at the
citadel. She came from Saxenmarken, from the state of Suobaland,
therefore she was called at Texland Suobene, although her name
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1739" href="#xd21e1739" name=
"xd21e1739">211</a>]</span>was Ifkja. Adel fell in love with her, and
she with him, but his father wished him to wait a little. Adel did as
he wished; but as soon as he was dead, sent messengers to Berthold, her
father, to ask her in marriage. Berthold was a prince of
high-principled feelings. He had sent his daughter to Texland in the
hope that she might be chosen Burgtmaagd in her country, but when he
knew of their mutual affection he bestowed his blessing upon them.
Ifkja was a clever Frisian. As far as I have been able to learn, she
always toiled and worked to bring the Frya&rsquo;s people back under
the same laws and customs. To bring the people to her side, she
travelled with her husband through all Saxenmarken, and also to
Geertmannia&mdash;as the Geertmen had named the country which they had
obtained by means of Gosa. Thence they went to Denmark, and from
Denmark by sea to Texland. From Texland they went to Westflyland, and
so along the coast to Walhallagara; thence they followed the Zuiderryn
(the Waal), till, with great apprehension, they arrived beyond the
Rhine at the Marsaten of whom our Apollonia has written. When they had
stayed there a little time, they returned to the lowlands. When they
had been some time descending towards the lowlands, and had reached
about the old citadel of Aken, four of their servants were suddenly
murdered and stripped. They had loitered a little behind. My brother,
who was always on the alert, had forbidden them to do so, but they did
not listen to him. The murderers that had committed this crime were
Twisklanders, who had at that time audaciously crossed the Rhine to
murder and to steal. The Twisklanders are banished and fugitive
children of Frya, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1741" href=
"#xd21e1741" name="xd21e1741">213</a>]</span>but their wives they have
stolen from the Tartars. The Tartars are a brown tribe of Finda&rsquo;s
people, who are thus named because they make war on everybody. They are
all horsemen and robbers. This is what makes the Twisklanders so
bloodthirsty. The Twisklanders who had done the wicked deed called
themselves Frijen or Franken. There were among them, my brother said,
red, brown, and white men. The red and brown made their hair white with
lime-water&mdash;but as their faces remained brown, they were only the
more ugly. In the same way as Apollonia, they visited Lydasburgt and
the Alderga. Afterwards they made a tour of all the neighbourhood of
Stavera. They behaved with so much amiability, that everywhere the
people wished to keep them. Three months later, Adel sent messengers to
all the friends that he had made, requesting them to send to him their
&ldquo;wise men&rdquo; in the month of May. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1743" href="#xd21e1743" name=
"xd21e1743">215</a>]</span></p>
<p>his wife, he said, who had been maagd of Texland, had received a
copy of it. In Texland many writings are still found which are not
copied in the book of the Adelingen. One of these writings had been
placed by Gosa with her last will, which was to be opened by the oldest
maiden, Albetha, as soon as Friso was dead.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Here is the Writing with Gosa&rsquo;s Advice.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Wr-alda gave children to the mothers of mankind,
he gave one language to every tongue and to all lips. This gift Wr-alda
had bestowed upon men in order that by its means they might make known
to each other what must be avoided and what must be followed to find
salvation, and to hold salvation to all eternity. Wr-alda is wise and
good, and all-foreseeing. As he knew that happiness and holiness would
flee from the earth when wickedness could overcome virtue, he has
attached to the language an equitable property. This property consists
in this, that men can neither lie nor use deceitful words without
stammering or blushing, by which means the innately bad are easily
known.</p>
<p>As thus our language opens the way to happiness and blessedness, and
thus helps to guard against evil inclinations, it is rightly named the
language of the gods, and all those by whom it is held in honour derive
honour from it. But what has happened? As soon as among our half
brothers and sisters deceivers arose, who gave themselves out as
servants of the good, it soon became otherwise. The deceitful priests
and the malignant princes, who always clung together, wished to live
according to their own inclinations, without regard to the laws of
right. In their wickedness they went <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1753" href="#xd21e1753" name="xd21e1753">217</a>]</span>so far as
to invent other languages, so that they might speak secretly in
anybody&rsquo;s presence of their wicked and unworthy affairs without
betraying themselves by stammering, and without showing a blush upon
their countenances. But what has that produced? Just as the seed of
good herbs which has been sown by good men in the open day springs up
from the ground, so time brings to light the evil seed which has been
sown by wicked men in secret and in darkness.</p>
<p>The wanton girls and effeminate youths who consorted with the
immoral priests and princes, taught the new language to their
companions, and thus spread it among the people till God&rsquo;s
language was clean forgotten. Would you know what came of all this? how
that stammering and blushing no longer betrayed their evil
doings;&mdash;virtue passed away, wisdom and liberty followed; unity
was lost, and quarrelling took its place; love flew away, and
unchastity and envy met round their tables; and where previously
justice reigned, now it is the sword. All are slaves&mdash;the subjects
of their masters, envy, bad passions and covetousness. If they had only
invented one language things might possibly have still gone on well;
but they invented as many languages as there are states, so that one
people can no more understand another people than a cow a dog, or a
wolf a sheep. The mariners can bear witness to this. From all this it
results that all the slave people look upon each other as strangers;
and that as a punishment of their inconsiderateness and presumption,
they must quarrel and fight till they are all destroyed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1757" href="#xd21e1757" name=

</div>
</div>
<div id="ch48" class="div1 chapter"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Here is my Counsel.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If you wish that you alone should inherit the earth,
you must never allow any language but God&rsquo;s language to pass your
lips, and take care that your own language remains free from outlandish
sounds. If you wish that some of Lyda&rsquo;s children and some of
Finda&rsquo;s children remain, you must do the same. The language of
the East Schoonlanders has been perverted by the vile Magyars, and the
language of the followers of Kaltana has been spoiled by the dirty
Gauls. Now, we have been weak enough to admit among us the returned
followers of Hellenia, but I anxiously fear that they will reward our
weakness by debasing our pure language.</p>
<p>Many things have happened to us, but among all the citadels that
have been disturbed and destroyed in the bad time, Irtha has preserved
Fryasburgt uninjured; and I may remark that Frya&rsquo;s or God&rsquo;s
language has always remained here untainted.</p>
<p>Here in Texland, therefore, schools should be established; and from
all the states that have kept to the old customs the young people
should be sent here, and afterwards those whose education is complete
can help those who remain at home. If foreigners come to buy ironwares
from you, and want to talk and bargain, they must come back to
God&rsquo;s language. If they learn God&rsquo;s language, then the
words, &ldquo;to be free&rdquo; and &ldquo;to have justice,&rdquo; will
come to them, and glimmer and glitter in their brains to a perfect
light, and that flame will destroy all bad princes and hypocritical
dirty priests.</p>
<p>The native and foreign messengers were pleased with that writing,
but no schools came from it. Then Adel established schools himself.
Every year Adel and Ifkja went to inspect the schools. If they found a
friendly feeling <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1770" href=
"#xd21e1770" name="xd21e1770">221</a>]</span>existing between the
natives and foreigners, they were extremely pleased. If there were any
who had sworn friendship together, they assembled the people, and with
great ceremony let them inscribe their names in a book which was called
the Book of Friendship, and afterwards a festival was held. All these
customs were kept up in order to bring together the separate branches
of Frya&rsquo;s race; but the maidens who were opposed to Adel and
Ifkja said that they did it for no other reason than to make a name for
themselves, and to bring all the other states under their
subjection.</p>
<p>Among my father&rsquo;s papers I found a letter from Liudgert the
Geertman. Omitting some passages which only concern my father, I
proceed to relate the rest.</p>
<p>Punjab, that is five rivers, and by which we travel, is a river of
extraordinary beauty, and is called Five Rivers, because four other
streams flow into the sea by its mouth. Far away to the eastward is
another large river, the Holy or Sacred Ganges. Between these two
rivers is the land of the Hindoos. Both rivers run from the high
mountains to the plains. The mountains in which their sources lie are
so high that they reach the heavens (laia), and therefore these
mountains are called Himmellaia. Among the Hindoos and others out of
these countries there are people who meet together secretly. They
believe that they are pure children of Finda, and that Finda was born
in the Himmellaia mountains, whence she went with her children to the
lowlands. Some of them believe that she, with her children, floated
down upon the foam of the Ganges, and that that is the reason why the
river is called the Sacred Ganges. But the priests, who came from
another country, traced out these people and had them burnt, so that
they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1776" href="#xd21e1776" name=
"xd21e1776">223</a>]</span>do not dare to declare openly their creed.
In this country all the priests are fat and rich. In their churches
there are all kinds of monstrous images, many of them of gold. To the
west of the Punjab are the Yren (Iraniers), or morose (Drangianen), the
Gedrosten (Gedrosiers), or runaways, and the Urgetten, or forgotten.
These names are given by the priests out of spite, because they fled
from their customs and religion. On their arrival our forefathers
likewise established themselves to the east of the Punjab, but on
account of the priests they likewise went to the west. In that way we
learned to know the Yren and other people. The Yren are not savages,
but good people, who neither pray to nor tolerate images; neither will
they suffer priests or churches; but as we adhere to the light of
Fasta, so they everywhere maintain fire in their houses. Coming still
further westward, we arrive at the Gedrosten. Regarding the Gedrosten:
They have been mixed with other people, and speak a variety of
languages. These people are really savage murderers, who always wander
about the country on horseback hunting and robbing, and hire themselves
as soldiers to the surrounding princes, at whose command they destroy
whatever they can reach.</p>
<p>The country between the Punjab and the Ganges is as flat as
Friesland near the sea, and consists of forests and fields, fertile in
every part, but this does not prevent the people from dying by
thousands of hunger. The famines, however, must not be attributed to
Wr-alda or Irtha, but to the princes and priests. The Hindoos are timid
and submissive before their princes, like hinds before wolves.
Therefore the Yren and others have called them Hindoos, which means
hinds. But their timidity is frightfully abused. If strangers come to
purchase corn, everything is turned <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1780" href="#xd21e1780" name="xd21e1780">225</a>]</span>into
money, and this is not prevented by the priests, because they, being
more crafty and rapacious than all the princes put together, know very
well that all the money will come into their pockets. Besides what the
people suffer from their princes, they suffer a great deal from
poisonous and wild beasts. There are great elephants that sometimes go
about in whole flocks and trample down corn-fields and whole villages.
There are great black and white cats which are called tigers. They are
as large as calves, and they devour both men and beasts. Besides other
creeping animals there are snakes from the size of a worm to the size
of a tree. The largest can swallow a cow, but the smallest are the most
deadly. They conceal themselves among the fruits and flowers, and
surprise the people who come to gather them. Any one who is bitten by
them is sure to die, as Irtha has given no antidote to their poison,
because the people have so given themselves up to idolatry. There are,
besides, all sorts of lizards, tortoises, and crocodiles. All these
reptiles, like the snakes, vary from the size of a worm to the trunk of
a tree. According to their size and fierceness, they have names which I
cannot recollect, but the largest are called alligators, because they
eat as greedily the putrid cattle that float down the stream as they do
living animals that they seize. On the west of the Punjab where we come
from, and where I was born, the same fruits and crops grow as on the
east side. Formerly there existed also the same crawling animals, but
our forefathers burnt all the underwood, and so diligently hunted all
the wild animals, that there are scarcely any left. To the extreme west
of the Punjab there is found rich clay land <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1782" href="#xd21e1782" name=
"xd21e1782">227</a>]</span>as well as barren heaths, which seem
endless, occasionally varied lovely spots on which the eye rests
enchanted. Among the fruits there are many that I have not found here.
Among the various kinds of corn some is as yellow as gold. There are
also golden apples, of which some are as sweet as honey and others as
sour as vinegar. In our country there are nuts as large as a
child&rsquo;s head. They contain cheese and milk. When they are old oil
is made from them. Of the husks ropes are made, and of the shells cups
and other household utensils are made. I have found in the woods here
bramble and holly berries. In my country we have trees bearing berries,
as large as your lime-trees, the berries of which are much sweeter and
three times as large as your gooseberries. When the days are at the
longest, and the sun is in the zenith, a man&rsquo;s body has no
shadow. If you sail very far to the south and look to the east at
midday, the sun shines on your left side as it does in other countries
on the right side. With this I will finish. It will be easy for you, by
means of what I have written, to distinguish between false accounts and
true descriptions.&mdash;Your Luidgert.</p>

Juul Feast.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">My greeting to all of you whose forefathers came here
with Friso. According to what you say, you are not guilty of idolatry.
I will not speak about that now, but will at once mention a failing
which is very little better. You know, or you do not know, how many
titles Wr-alda has; but you all know that he is named universal
provider, because that everything comes and proceeds from him for the
sustenance of his creatures. It is true that Irtha is named sometimes
the feeder of all, because she brings forth all the fruits and grains
on which men and beasts are fed; but she would not bear any fruit or
grain unless Wr-alda gave her the power. Women who nourish their
children at their breasts are called nurses, but if Wr-alda did not
give them milk the children would find no advantage; so that, in short,
Wr-alda really is the nourisher. That Irtha should be called the
universal nourisher, and that a mother should be called a feeder, one
can understand, figuratively speaking; but that a father should be
called a feeder, because he is a father, goes against all reason. Now I
know whence all this folly comes. Listen to me. It comes from our
enemies; and if this is followed up you will become slaves, to the
sorrow of Frya and to the punishment of your pride, I will tell you
what happened to the slave people; from that you may take warning. The
foreign kings, who follow their own will, place Wr-alda below the
crown. From envy that Wr-alda is called the universal father, they wish
also to be called fathers of the people. Now, everybody knows that
kings do not regulate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1799" href=
"#xd21e1799" name="xd21e1799">231</a>]</span>the productiveness of the
earth; and that they have their sustenance by means of the people, but
still they will persist in their arrogance. In order to attain their
object they were not satisfied from the beginning with free gifts, but
imposed a tax upon the people. With the tax thus raised they hired
foreign soldiers, whom they retained about their courts. Afterwards
they took as many wives as they pleased, and the smaller princes and
gentry did the same. When, in consequence, quarrels and disputes arose
in the households, and complaints were made about it, they said every
man is the father (feeder) of his household, therefore he shall be
master and judge over it. Thus arose arbitrariness, and as the men
ruled over their households the kings would do over their people. When
the kings had accomplished that, they should be called fathers of the
people, they had statues of themselves made, and erected in the
churches beside the statues of the idols, and those who would not bow
down to them were either killed or put in chains. Your forefathers and
the Twisklanders had intercourse with the kings, and learned these
follies from them. But it is not only that some of your men have been
guilty of stealing titles, I have also much to complain of against your
wives. If there are men among you who wish to put themselves on a level
with Wr-alda, there are also women who wish to consider themselves
equals of Frya. Because they have borne children, they call themselves
mothers; but they forget that Frya bore children without having
intercourse with a man. Yes, they not only have desired to rob Frya and
the Eeremoeders of their honourable title (with whom they cannot put
themselves upon an equality), but they do the same with the honourable
titles of their fellow-creatures. There are women who allow themselves
to be called ladies, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1801" href=
"#xd21e1801" name="xd21e1801">233</a>]</span>although they know that
that only belongs to the wives of princes. They also let their
daughters be called maagden, although they know that no young girls are
so called unless they belong to a citadel. You all fancy that you are
the better for this name-stealing, but you forget that jealousy clings
to it, and that every wrong sows the seed of its own rod. If you do not
alter your course, in time it will grow so strong that you cannot see
what will be the end. Your descendants will be flogged by it, and will
not know whence the stripes come. But although you do not build
citadels for the maidens and leave them to their fate, there will still
remain some who will come out of woods and caves, and will prove to
your descendants that you have by your disorderliness been the cause of
it. Then you will be damned. Your ghosts will rise frightened out of
their graves. They will call upon Wr-alda, Frya, and her maidens, but
they shall receive no succour before the Juul shall enter upon a new
circuit, and that will only be three thousand years after this
century.</p>
<p class="xd21e154">The end of Rika&rsquo;s letter. <span class=

<p>therefore I will first write about black Adel. Black Adel was the
fourth king after Friso. In his youth he studied first at Texland, and
then at Staveren, and afterwards travelled through all the states. When
he was twenty-four years old his father had him elected Asega-Asker. As
soon as he became Asker he always took the part of the poor. The rich,
he said, do enough of wrong by means of their wealth, therefore we
ought to take care that the poor look up to us. By arguments of this
kind he became the friend of the poor and the terror of the rich. It
was carried so far that his father looked up to him. When his father
died he succeeded, and then he wished to retain his office as well, as
the kings of the East used to do. The rich would not suffer this, so
all the people rose up, and the rich were glad to get out of the
assembly with whole skins. From that time there was no more talk of
equality. He oppressed the rich and flattered the poor, by whose
assistance he succeeded in all his wishes. King Askar, as he was always
called, was seven feet high, and his strength was as remarkable as his
height. He had a clear intellect, so that he understood all that was
talked about, but in his actions he did not display much wisdom. He had
a handsome countenance and a smooth tongue, but his soul was blacker
than his hair. When he had been king for a year, he obliged all the
young men in the state to come once a year to the camp to have a sham
fight. At first he had some trouble with it, but at last it became such
a habit that old and young came from all sides to ask if they might
take part in it. When he had brought it to this point, he established
military schools. The rich complained that their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1808" href="#xd21e1808" name=
"xd21e1808">237</a>]</span>children no longer learned to read and
write. Askar paid no attention to it; but shortly afterwards, when a
sham fight was held, he mounted a throne and spoke aloud: The rich have
come to complain to me that their boys do not learn to read and write.
I answered nothing; but I will now declare my opinion, and let the
general assembly decide. While they all regarded him with curiosity, he
said further: According to my idea, we ought to leave reading and
writing at present to the maagden and wise people. I do not wish to
speak ill of our forefathers; I will only say that in the times so
vaunted by some, the Burgtmaagden introduced disputes into our country,
which the mothers were unable, either first or last, to put an end to.
Worse still, while they talked and chattered about useless customs the
Gauls came and seized all our beautiful southern country. Even at this
very time our degenerate brothers and their soldiers have already come
over the Scheldt. It therefore remains for us to choose whether we will
carry a yoke or a sword. If we wish to be and to remain free, it
behoves our young men to leave reading and writing alone for a time;
and instead of playing games of swinging and wrestling, they must learn
to play with sword and spear. When we are completely prepared, and the
boys are big enough to carry helmet and shield and to use their
weapons, then, with your help, I will attack the enemy. The Gauls may
then record the defeat of their helpers and soldiers upon our fields
with the blood that flows from their wounds. When we have once expelled
the enemy, then we must follow it up till there are no more Gauls,
Slaves, or Tartars to be driven out of Frya&rsquo;s inheritance. That
is right, the majority shouted, and the rich did not dare to open their
mouths. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1810" href="#xd21e1810"

<p>He must certainly have thought over this address and had it written
out, for on the evening of the same day there were copies in at least
twenty different hands, and they all sounded the same. Afterwards he
ordered the ship people to make double prows, upon which steel
crossbows could be fixed. Those who were backward in doing this were
fined, and if they swore that they had no means, the rich men of the
village were obliged to pay. Now we shall see what resulted from all
this bustle. In the north part of Britain there exists a Scotch
people&mdash;the most of them spring from Frya&rsquo;s blood&mdash;some
of them are descended from the followers of Keltana, and, for the rest,
from Britons and fugitives who gradually, in the course of time, took
refuge there from the tin mines. Those who come from the tin mines have
wives, either altogether foreign or of foreign descent They are all
under the dominion of the Gauls. Their arms are wooden bows and arrows
pointed with stag&rsquo;s-horn or flint. Their houses are of turf and
straw, and some of them live in caves in the mountains. Sheep that they
have stolen form their only wealth. Some of the descendants of
Keltana&rsquo;s followers still have iron weapons, which they have
inherited from their forefathers. In order to make myself well
understood, I must let alone for a while my account of the Scotch
people, and write something about the near Krekalanders (Italians). The
Krekalanders formerly belonged to us only, but from time immemorial
descendants of Lyda and Finda have established themselves there. Of
these last there came in the end a whole troop from Troy. Troy is the
name of a town that the far Krekalanders (Greeks) had taken and
destroyed. When the Trojans had nestled themselves among the near
Krekalanders, with time and industry they built a strong town with
walls and citadels named Rome, that is, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1813" href="#xd21e1813" name="xd21e1813">241</a>]</span>Spacious.
When this was done, the people by craft and force made themselves
masters of the whole land. The people who live on the south side of the
Mediterranean Sea, come for the most part from Ph&oelig;nicia. The
Ph&oelig;nicians (Puniers or Carthaginians) are a bastard race of the
blood of Frya, Finda, and Lyda. The Lyda people were there as slaves,
but by the unchastity of the women these black people have degenerated
the other people and dyed them brown. These people and the Romans are
constantly struggling for the supremacy over the Mediterranean Sea. The
Romans, moreover, live at enmity with the Ph&oelig;nicians; and their
priests, who wish to assume the sole government of the world, cannot
bear the sight of the Gauls. First they took from the Phoenicians
Marseilles&mdash;then all the countries lying to the south, the west,
and the north, as well as the southern part of Britain&mdash;and they
have always driven away the Ph&oelig;nician priests, that is the Gauls,
of whom thousands have sought refuge in North Britain. A short time ago
the chief of the Gauls was established in the citadel, which is called
Kerenac (Karnac), that is the corner, whence he issued his commands to
the Gauls. All their gold was likewise collected there. Keeren Herne
(chosen corner), or Kerenac, is a stone citadel which did belong to
Kalta. Therefore the maidens of the descendants of Kaltana&rsquo;s
followers wished to have the citadel again. Thus through the enmity of
the maidens and the Gaul&rsquo;s, hatred and quarrelling spread ever
the mountain country with fire and sword. Our sea people often came
there to get wool, which they paid for with prepared hides and linen.
Askar had often gone with them, and had secretly made friendship with
the maidens and some princes, and bound himself to drive the Gauls out
of Kerenac. When he came back there again he gave to the princes and
the fighting men iron helmets and steel bows. War had come with him,
and soon blood was streaming down <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1815" href="#xd21e1815" name="xd21e1815">243</a>]</span>the
slopes of the mountains. When Askar thought a favourable opportunity
occurred, he vent with forty ships and took Kerenac and the chief of
the Gauls, with all his gold. The people with whom he fought against
the soldiers of the Gauls, he had enticed out of the Saxenmarken by
promises of much booty and plunder. Thus nothing was left to the Gauls.
After that he took two islands for stations for his ships, from which
he used later to sally forth and plunder all the Ph&oelig;nician ships
and towns that he could reach. When he returned he brought nearly six
hundred of the finest youths of the Scotch mountaineers with him. He
said that they had been given him as hostages, that he might be sure
that the parents would remain faithful to him; but this was untrue. He
kept them as a bodyguard at his court, where they had daily lessons in
riding and in the use of all kinds of arms. The Denmarkers, who proudly
considered themselves sea-warriors above all the other sea-people, no
sooner heard of the glorious deeds of Askar, than they became jealous
of him to such a degree, that they would bring war over the sea and
over his lands. See here, then, how he was able to avoid a war. Among
the ruins of the destroyed citadel of Stavia there was still
established a clever Burgtmaagd, with a few maidens. Her name was
Reintja, and she was famed for her wisdom. This maid offered her
assistance to Askar, on condition that he should afterwards rebuild the
citadel of Stavia. When he had bound himself to do this, Reintja went
with three maidens to Hals (Holstein). She travelled by night, and by
day she made speeches in all the markets and in all the assemblies.
Wr-alda, she said, had told her by his thunder that all the
Frya&rsquo;s people must become friends, and united as brothers and
sisters, otherwise Finda&rsquo;s people would come and sweep them off
the face of the earth. After the thunder Frya&rsquo;s seven
watch-maidens appeared to her in a dream seven nights in succession.
They had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1817" href="#xd21e1817"
name="xd21e1817">245</a>]</span>said, Disaster hovers over Frya&rsquo;s
land with yoke and chains; therefore all the people who have sprung
from Frya&rsquo;s blood must do away with their surnames, and only call
themselves Frya&rsquo;s children, or Frya&rsquo;s people. They must all
rise up and drive Finda&rsquo;s people out of Frya&rsquo;s inheritance.
If you will not do that, you will bring the slave-chains round your
necks, and the foreign chiefs will ill-treat your children and flog
them till the blood streams into your graves. Then shall the spirits of
your forefathers appear to you, and reproach your cowardice and
thoughtlessness. The stupid people who, by the acts of the Magyars,
were already so much accustomed to folly, believed all that she said,
and the mothers clasped their children to their bosoms. When Reintja
had brought the king of Holstein and the others to an agreement, she
sent messengers to Askar, and went herself along the Baltic Sea. From
there she went to the Lithauers (Face-hewers), so called because they
always strike at their enemy&rsquo;s face. The Lithauers are fugitives
and banished people of our own race, who wander about in the
Twisklanden. Their wives have been mostly stolen from the Tartars. The
Tartars are a branch of Finda&rsquo;s race, and are thus named by the
Twisklanders because they never will be at peace, but provoke people to
fight. She proceeded on beyond the Saxsenmarken, crossing through the
other Twisklanders in order always to repeat the same thing. After two
years had passed, she came along the Rhine home. Among the Twisklanders
she gave herself out for a mother, and said that they might return as
free and true people; but then they must go over the Rhine and drive
the Gauls out of Frya&rsquo;s south lands. If they did that, then her
King Askar would go over the Scheldt and win back the land. Among the
Twisklanders many bad customs of the Tartars and Magyars have crept in,
but likewise many of our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1819" href=
"#xd21e1819" name="xd21e1819">247</a>]</span>laws have remained.
Therefore they still have Maagden, who teach the children and advise
the old. In the beginning they were opposed to Reintja, but at last she
was followed, obeyed, and praised by them where it was useful or
necessary.</p>

<p>As soon as Askar heard from Reintja&rsquo;s messengers how the
Jutlanders were disposed, he immediately, on his side, sent messengers
to the King of Hals. The ship in which the messengers went was laden
with women&rsquo;s ornaments, and took also a golden shield on which
Askar&rsquo;s portrait was artistically represented. These messengers
were to ask the King&rsquo;s daughter, Frethogunsta, in marriage for
Askar. Frethogunsta came a year after that to Staveren. Among her
followers was a Magy, for the Jutlanders had been long ago corrupted.
Soon after Askar had married Frethogunsta, a church was built at
Staveren. In the church were placed monstrous images, bedecked with
gold-woven dresses. It is also said that Askar, by night, and at
unseasonable times, kneeled to them with Frethogunsta; but one thing is
certain, the citadel of Stavia was never rebuilt. Reintja was already
come back, and went angrily to Prontlik the mother, at Texland, to
complain. Prontlik sent out messengers in all directions, who
proclaimed that Askar is gone over to Idolatry. Askar took no notice of
this, but unexpectedly a fleet arrived from Hals. In the night the
maidens were driven out of the citadel, and in the morning there was
nothing to be seen of the citadel but a glowing heap of rubbish.
Prontlik and Reintja came to me for shelter. When I reflected upon it,
I thought that it might prove bad for my state. Therefore, we hit upon
a plan which might serve us all. This is the way we went to work. In
the middle of the Krijlwood, to the east of Liudwerd, lies our place of
refuge, which can only be reached by a concealed path. A long time ago
I had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1828" href="#xd21e1828" name=
"xd21e1828">249</a>]</span>established a garrison of young men who all
hated Askar, and kept away all other people. Now it was come to such a
pitch among us, that many women, and even men, talked about ghosts,
white women, and gnomes, just like the Denmarkers. Askar had made use
of all these follies for his own advantage, and we wished to do the
same. One dark night I brought the Maagden to the citadel, and
afterwards they went with their serving-maids dressed in white along
the path, so that nobody dare go there any more. When Askar thought he
had his hands free, he let the Magyars travel through his states under
all kinds of names, and, except in my state, they were not turned away
anywhere. After that Askar had become so connected with the Jutlanders
and the Denmarkers, they all went roving together; but it produced no
real good to them. They brought all sorts of foreign treasures home,
and just for that reason the young men would learn no trades, nor work
in the fields; so at last he was obliged to take slaves; but that was
altogether contrary to Wr-alda&rsquo;s wish and to Frya&rsquo;s
counsel. Therefore the punishment was sure to follow it. This is the
way in which the punishment came. They had all together taken a whole
fleet that came out of the Mediterranean Sea. This fleet was laden with
purple cloths and other valuables that came from Phoenicia. The weak
people of the fleet were put ashore south of the Seine, but the strong
people were kept to serve as slaves. The handsomest were retained
ashore, and the ugly and black were kept on board ship as rowers. In
the Fly the plunder was divided, but, without their knowing it, they
divided the punishment too. Of those who were placed in the foreign
ships six died of colic. It was thought that the food and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1830" href="#xd21e1830" name=
"xd21e1830">251</a>]</span>drink were poisoned, so it was all thrown
overboard, but the colic remained all the same. Wherever the slaves or
the goods came, there it came too. The Saxsenmen took it over to their
marches. The Jutlanders brought it to Schoonland and along the coasts
of the Baltic Sea, and with Askar&rsquo;s mariners it was taken to
Britain. We and the people of Gr&ecirc;neg&acirc; did not allow either
the people or the goods to come over our boundaries, and therefore we
remained free from it. How many people were carried off by this disease
I cannot tell; but Prontlik, who heard it afterwards from the maidens,
told me that Askar had helped out of his states a thousand times more
free-men than he had brought dirty slaves in. When the pest had ceased,
the Twisklanders who had become free came to the Rhine, but Askar would
not put himself on an equality with the princes of that vile degenerate
race. He would not suffer them to call themselves Frya&rsquo;s
children, as Reintja had offered them, but he forgot then that he
himself had black hair. Among the Twisklanders there were two tribes
who did not call themselves Twisklanders. One came from the far
south-east, and called themselves Allemannen. They had given themselves
this name when they had no women among them, and were wandering as
exiles in the forests. Later on they stole women from the slave people
like the Lithauers, but they kept their name. The other tribe, that
wandered about in the neighbourhood, called themselves Franks, not
because they were free, but the name of their first king was Frank,
who, by the help of the degenerate maidens, had had himself made
hereditary king over his people. The people nearest to him called
themselves Thioth&mdash;his sons&mdash;that is, sons of the people.
They had remained free, because they never would acknowledge any king,
or prince, or master except those chosen by general consent in a
general assembly. Askar had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1832"
href="#xd21e1832" name="xd21e1832">253</a>]</span>already learned from
Reintja that the Twisklander princes were almost always at war with
each other. He proposed to them that they should choose a duke from his
people, because, as he said, he was afraid that they would quarrel
among themselves for the supremacy. He said also that his princes could
speak with the Gauls. This, he said, was also the opinion of the
mother. Then the princes of the Twisklanders came together, and after
twenty-one days they chose Alrik as duke. Alrik was Askar&rsquo;s
nephew. He gave him two hundred Scotch and one hundred of the greatest
Saksmannen to go with him as a bodyguard, The princes were to send
twenty-one of their sons as hostages for their fidelity. Thus far all
had gone according to his wishes; but when they were to go over the
Rhine, the king of the Franks would not be under Alrik&rsquo;s command.
Thereupon all was confusion. Askar, who thought that all was going on
well, landed with his ships on the other side of the Scheldt; but there
they were already aware of his coming, and were on their guard. He had
to flee as quickly as he had come, and was himself taken prisoner. The
Gauls did not know whom they had taken, so he was afterwards exchanged
for a noble Gaul whom Askar&rsquo;s people had taken with them. While
all this was going on, the Magyars went about audaciously over the
lands of our neighbours. Near Egmuda, where formerly the citadel Forana
had stood, they built a church larger and richer than that which Askar
had built at Staveren. They said afterwards that Askar had lost the
battle against the Gauls, because the people did not believe that Wodin
could help them, and therefore they would not pray to him. They went
about stealing young children, whom they kept and brought up in the
mysteries of their abominable doctrines. Were there people who</p>
